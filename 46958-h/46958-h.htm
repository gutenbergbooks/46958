<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>


<p>He was a Northern journalist, and it was in the interest
of his paper that he found himself, one bright March
morning, in New Orleans, almost dazed by the rapidity
with which he had been whirled from the ice and snow of
the frozen North to the sunshine and flowers of the sunny
South.</p>

<p>He was charmed with the quaint and unique Crescent
City. It was a totally different world from that in which
he had been reared&mdash;a summer land, warm, indolent, luxurious,
where one plucked the golden oranges from the
dark-green boughs, laden at once with flowers and fruit,
and where the senses were taken captive by the sensuous
perfume of rare flowers that, in his Northern land, grew
only within the confines of the close conservatory. Then,
too, the dark, handsome faces of the people, and their
mixture of foreign tongues, had their own peculiar charm.
Nothing amused him so much as a stroll through the
antique French Market, with its lavish abundance of tropic
vegetables, fruits, and flowers, vended by hucksters of
different nationalities in the Babel of languages that
charmed his ear with the languorous softness of the
Southern accent.</p>

<p>He had a letter of introduction to a member of the
Jockey Club, and this famous organization at once adopted
him, and, as he phrased it, "put him through." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
theaters, the carnival, the races, all whirled past in a blaze
of splendor never to be forgotten; for it was at the famous
Metairie Race-course that he first met Mme. Lorraine.</p>

<p>But you must not think, reader, because I forgot to tell
you his name at first, that he is the Little Nobody of my
story. He was not little at all, but tall and exceedingly
well-favored, and signed his name Eliot Van Zandt.</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine was a retired actress&mdash;ballet-dancer,
some said. She was a French woman, airy and charming,
like the majority of her race. The Jockey Club petted
her, although they freely owned that she was a trifle fast,
and did not have the <i>entrée</i> of some of the best houses in
the city. However, there were some nice, fashionable
people not so strait-laced who sent her cards to their fêtes,
and now and then accepted return invitations, so that it
could not be said that she was outside the pale of society.</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine took a fancy to the good-looking Yankee,
as she dubbed him, and gave him <i>carte blanche</i> to call at
her <i>bijou</i> house in Esplanade Street. He accepted with
outward eagerness and inward indifference. He was too
familiar with women of her type at the North&mdash;fast, frivolous,
and avaricious&mdash;to be flattered by her notice or her
invitation.</p>

<p>"She may do for the rich Jockey Club, but her acquaintance
is too expensive a luxury for a poor devil of a
newspaper correspondent," he told the Club. "She has
card-parties, of course, and I am too poor to gamble."</p>

<p>Pierre Carmontelle laughed, and told him to call in the
afternoon, when there was no gambling in the <i>recherché</i>
saloon.</p>

<p>"To see madame at home, informally, with her little
savage, would be rich, <i>mon ami</i>. You would get a spicy
paragraph for your newspaper," he said.</p>

<p>"Her little savage?"</p>

<p>"Do not ask me any questions, for I shall not answer,"
said Carmontelle, still laughing. "Perhaps Remond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
there will gratify your curiosity. The little vixen flung
her tiny slipper into his face once when he tried to kiss
her, under the influence of a <i>soupçon</i> too much of
madame's foamy champagne."</p>

<p>"Madame's daughter, perhaps?" said Van Zandt, looking
at Remond; but the latter only scowled and muttered,
under his breath:</p>

<p>"The little demon!"</p>

<p>He thought they were guying him, and decided not to
call in Esplanade Street.</p>

<p>But it was only one week later that he saw Mme. Lorraine
again at Metairie. Her carriage was surrounded by
admirers, and she was betting furiously on the racing, but
she found time to see the Yankee and beckon him importunately
with her dainty, tan-kidded hand.</p>

<p>They made way for him to come to her where she sat
among her silken cushions, resplendent in old-gold satin,
black lace, and Maréchal Niel roses, her beautiful, brilliant
face wreathed in smiles, her toilet so perfectly appointed
that she looked barely twenty-five, although the Club admitted
that she must be past forty.</p>

<p>"It is fifteen years since Lorraine married her off the
stage, and she had been starring it ten years before he
ever saw her," said Carmontelle, confidentially.</p>

<p>The big, almond-shaped dark eyes flashed reproachfully,
as she said, with her prettiest <i>moue</i>:</p>

<p>"You naughty Yankee, you have not called!"</p>

<p>"I have been too busy," he fibbed; "but I am coming
this evening."</p>

<p>"<i>Quel plaisir</i>!" she exclaimed, and then the racing
distracted their attention again.</p>

<p>The blaze of sunshine fell on one of the gayest scenes
ever witnessed. The old race-course was surrounded by
thousands upon thousands of people in carriages, on horseback,
and afoot. The grand stand was packed with a living
mass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The tropical beauty and rich costumes of the Louisiana
ladies lent glow and brilliancy to the exciting scene. The
racing was superb, and men and women were betting freely
on their favorites. Gloves and jewels and thousands of
dollars were won and lost that day.</p>

<p>The most interesting event of the day was on. A purse
of gold had been offered for the most skillful and daring
equestrienne, and the fair contestants were ranged before
the judge's stand, magnificently mounted on blooded steeds
curveting with impatient ardor, their silver-mounted trappings
glistening in the sunlight, and their handsome riders
clothed faultlessly in habits of dark rich cloth fitting like
a glove. It was truly a splendid sight, and the Jockey
Club immediately went wild, and cheered as if they would
split their throats. Even Mme. Lorraine brought her
gloved hands impetuously together as the five beauties
rode dauntlessly forward.</p>

<p>"Jove! how magnificent!" Carmontelle burst forth.
"But, madame, look!" excitedly. "Who is that little
tot on the Arab so like your own? Heavens! it is&mdash;it
is&mdash;" Without completing the sentence, he fell back
convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>Every one was looking eagerly at the slip of a girl on
the back of the beautiful, shiny-coated Arab. She rode
skillfully, with daring grace, yet reckless <i>abandon</i>&mdash;a girl,
a child almost, the lissom, budding figure sitting erect and
motionless in the saddle, a stream of ruddy golden hair flying
behind her on the breeze, the small, white face staring
straight before her as she swept on impetuously to the victory
that every one was proclaiming would perch upon her
banner.</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine's face paled with blended dismay and
anger. She muttered, loud enough for the Yankee to
overhear:</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! the daring little hussy! She shall pay for
this escapade!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>But to her admirers she exclaimed, a moment later, with
a careless, significant shrug of the shoulders:</p>

<p>"She has stolen a march upon me. But, pshaw! it is
nothing for her, the little savage! You should have seen
her mother, the bare-back rider, galloping at her highest
speed and jumping through the hoops in the ring!"</p>

<p>"<i>Vive</i> the little savage!" cried Remond, his dark face
relaxing into enthusiasm. "She has stolen a march upon
you, indeed, madame, has she not?"</p>

<p>Madame frowned and retorted, sharply:</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur; but I will make her pay for this!
The idea of her racing my Arab, my splendid Arab, that I
care for so guardedly! Why, one of his slender hoofs is
worth more to me than the girl's whole body! Oh, yes, I
will make her pay!"</p>

<p>The journalist's dancing gray eyes turned on her face
curiously.</p>

<p>"She belongs to you?"</p>

<p>"In a way, yes," madame answered, with a sharp, unpleasant
laugh. "Her mother, my maid, had the bad
taste to die in my employ and leave the baggage on my
hands. She has grown up in my house like an unchecked
weed, and has furnished some amusement for the Jockey
Club."</p>

<p>"As a sort of Daughter of the Regiment," said one,
laughing; but madame frowned the more darkly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Markham," she said, shortly. "Do not
put such notions into Monsieur Van Zandt's head. Let
him understand, once for all, she is a cipher, a little nobody."</p>

<p>She did not quite understand the gleam in the dark-gray
eyes, but he smiled carelessly enough, and replied:</p>

<p>"At least she is very brave."</p>

<p>"A madcap," madame answered, shortly; and just
then a shriek of triumph from a thousand throats rent the
air. The meteor-like figure of the golden-haired girl on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the flying Arab had distanced every competitor, and the
applause was tremendous. In the midst of it all she reined
in her gallant steed a moment before the judges' stand,
then, before the dust cleared away, she was galloping
rapidly off the grounds, followed by every eye among them
all; while Mme. Lorraine, beneath an indifferent air, concealed
a hidden volcano of wrath and passion.</p>

<p>She stayed for the rest of the races, but her mind was
only half upon them now, and she made some wild bets,
and lost every stake. She could think of nothing but the
daring girl who had taken her own Selim, her costly, petted
Arab, and ridden him before her eyes in that wild race
in which she had won such a signal victory.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>Van Zandt determined to keep his promise to call in
Esplanade Street that evening. He felt a languid curiosity
over Mme. Lorraine's charge, the daring girl whose whole
young body was worth less to madame than one of the
slender hoofs of her favorite Selim.</p>

<p>He arrived early, and was ushered into an exquisite
little salon all in olive and gold&mdash;fit setting for madame's
ripe, dusky beauty. She was alone, looking magnificent
in ruby velvet with cream lace garnishing and ruby jewelry,
and the smile with which she received him was welcome
itself.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>mon ami</i>! I was wondering if you would really
come," she said, archly. "Sit here beside me, and tell
me how you enjoyed the day?"</p>

<p>She swept aside her glowing draperies, and gave him
a seat by her side on the olive satin sofa. He accepted it
with an odd sensation of disappointment, despite her
luring beauty and the sensuous comfort and luxury of the
room, whose air was heavy with the perfume of flowers in
vases and pots all about them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>He thought, disappointedly:</p>

<p>"Am I not to see her Little Nobody?"</p>

<p>Apparently not, for no one entered, and madame sat
contentedly by his side, talking arch nothings to him, fluttering
her fan coquettishly, and laughing at his careless
repartee. Not a word all the while of her whom madame
had sworn should pay for her madcap freak of to-day.</p>

<p>By and by came Carmontelle, Remond, and Markham.
They laughed at finding Van Zandt before them.</p>

<p>"But, madame, where is your Little Nobody?" queried
the gay Carmontelle. "We are come to lay our hearts at
her feet. Know that she has supplanted you in the adoration
of the Jockey Club. Her victory to-day makes us all
her slaves."</p>

<p>Madame gave utterance to a light, mocking laugh as
she touched the gilded bell-cord close to her hand, and all
eyes turned to the door. Five, almost ten, minutes passed,
then it was softly opened, and a girl came in with a silver
salver heaped high with luscious tropical fruit.</p>

<p>Van Zandt recognized her as the winner of the race by
the wealth of tawny golden hair that flowed down her back
below her slim, girlish waist. He waited, with his eyes on
the strange young face, for madame to speak some words
of introduction, but none came. Just as any other servant
might have entered, so was this girl permitted to enter.
The fellows from the Jockey Club nodded familiarly at
her, and received a sulky stare in return as she dispensed
her fruit among them with impatient courtesy.</p>

<p>When she paused, last of all, before Mme. Lorraine,
with her salver of fruit, she seemed first to observe the
tall, fair man by her side. She started and fixed her big,
solemn, dark eyes half wonderingly upon him, and for a
second they gazed silently and curiously at each other.</p>

<p>He saw a girl of fifteen or so, very <i>petite</i> for her age,
and made to look more so by the fashion of her dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
which consisted mainly of a loosely fashioned white embroidered
slip, low in the neck, short in the sleeves, and
so short in the skirt that it reached the verge of immodesty
by betraying much more than the conventional limit of the
tapering ankles and rounded limbs. Madame had evidently
aimed more at picturesqueness than propriety in
choosing her dress, and she had certainly attained her
point. Anything more full of unstudied grace and unconscious
beauty than the little serving-maid it would be hard
to imagine. The contrast of tawny golden hair with dark
eyes and slender, jetty brows, with features molded in the
most bewitching lines, and form as perfect as a sculptor's
model, made up a <i>tout ensemble</i> very pleasing to the
journalist's observant eyes. There was but one defect,
and that was a certain sullenness of eyes and expression
that bespoke a fiery spirit at bay, a nature full of repressed
fire and passion ready to burst into lava-flame at a touch,
a word.</p>

<p>For her she saw a man of twenty-five or six, tall, manly,
and handsome in a splendid intellectual fashion, with fair
hair clustered above a grand white brow, blue-gray eyes
bright and laughing, a fair mustache ornamenting lips at
once firm and sweet, a chin that was grave and full of
power in spite of the womanish dimple that cleft it&mdash;altogether
a most attractive face, and one that influenced her
subtly, for some of the sullenness faded from her face, and
with brightening eyes she exclaimed, with all the freedom
of a child:</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you at sight! You are madame's handsome
Yankee, <i>n'est ce pas</i>?"</p>

<p>He rose, laughing, and with his most elaborate bow.</p>

<p>"Eliot Van Zandt, at your service," he said. "Yes,
I am the Yankee. And you?"</p>

<p>He saw the sullen gleam come back into her eyes, as she
answered curtly, and, as it seemed, with repressed wrath:</p>

<p>"Oh. I am Little Nobody, madame says. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
always been too poor to have even a name. Have some
fruit, please."</p>

<p>Madame tittered behind her elaborate fan, and the
members of the Jockey Club exchanged glances. Eliot
took an orange mechanically, and then the girl put the
salver down and turned to go.</p>

<p>But Mme. Lorraine's dark eyes looked over the top of
her fan with sarcastic amusement.</p>

<p>"Remain," she said, with cold brevity; and the girl
flung herself angrily down into a chair, with her hands
crossed and her tiny slippers dangling. With uplifted
eyes she studied intently the face of the stranger.</p>

<p>"Handsome, is he, madcap?" at length queried Carmontelle,
full of amusement.</p>

<p>The large eyes turned on his face scornfully.</p>

<p>"Handsomer than any of the ugly old Jockey Club!"
she replied, with decision.</p>

<p>"We shall all be very jealous of this Yankee," said
Markham. "Here we have been adoring you ever since
you were a baby, ma'amselle, and you throw us over in a
bunch for the sake of this charming stranger. You are
cruel, unjust." He began to hum, softly, meaningly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Do not trust him, gentle lady,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Though his words be low and sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heed not him that kneels before thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Gently pleading at thy feet.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song went no further, for the girl looked at him
with large eyes of sarcastic amusement and said, curtly:</p>

<p>"If I had such an atrocious voice as yours, I should not
try to sing."</p>

<p>A sally of laughter greeted the words, and the sulky
countenance relaxed into a smile.</p>

<p>Van Zandt studied the young face closely, his artistic
taste charmed by its bright, warm beauty, full of Southern
fire and passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"How came she, the nameless child of a circus-rider,
by her dower of high-bred, faultless beauty?" he thought,
in wonder, noticing the dainty white hands, the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"Delicate Arab arch of her feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grace that, light and bright as the crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a peacock, sits on her shining head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she knows it not. Oh, if she knew it!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know her beauty might half undo it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mme. Lorraine, at his side, watched him with lowered
lids and compressed lips. At last, tapping his arm with
her fan, and smiling archly, she said, in an under-tone:</p>

<p>"Beautiful, is she not, <i>mon ami</i>? But&mdash;that is all.
Her mind is a void, a blank&mdash;capable of nothing but the
emotions of anger or hatred, the same as the brute creation.
I have tried to educate her into a companion, but
in vain; so she can never be more than a pretty toy to me&mdash;no
more nor less than my Maltese kitten or my Spitz
puppy, although I like to see her about me, the same as I
love all beautiful things."</p>

<p>He heard her in amazement. Soulless&mdash;that beautiful,
spirited-looking creature! Could it be? He saw the dark
eyes lighten as the men began to praise her dauntless riding
that day. They were very expressive, those large,
almond-shaped eyes. Surely a soul dwelt behind those
dark-fringed lids.</p>

<p>Some one proposed cards, and madame assented with
alacrity, without seeing Eliot Van Zandt's gesture of disgust.
He refused point-blank to take a hand in the game,
and said, with reckless audacity:</p>

<p>"Do not mind me; I am always unlucky at play; so I
will amuse myself instead with Little Nobody."</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed, but when Mme. Lorraine vacated the
seat upon the sofa, she came over and took it, not with
any appearance of forwardness, but as a simple matter of
course. Then, looking up at him, she said, with child-like
directness:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"And so you are a Yankee? I am surprised. I have
always hated the Yankees, you know. My father was a
Confederate soldier, madame says. He was killed the last
year of the war, just a month before I was born."</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine looked around with a dark frown, but
Van Zandt pretended not to see it as he answered:</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you will not have me for your
friend, ma'amselle, because I was born in Boston, and because
my father fell fighting for the Stars and Stripes?"</p>

<p>"A friend? What is that, monsieur?" she queried,
naïvely; and Markham, to whom the conversation was
perfectly audible from his corner of the card-table, looked
around, and said, teasingly:</p>

<p>"It is something that you will never be able to keep,
ma'amselle, by reason of your pretty face. All your
friends will become your lovers."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Colonel Markham; I was not talking
to you, and it's ill manners to break into a conversation,"
said the girl, shortly.</p>

<p>She broke off a white camellia from a vase near her,
and held it lightly between her taper fingers as she again
addressed herself to the journalist:</p>

<p>"I like your word 'friend.' It has a nice sound. But
I don't quite understand."</p>

<p>"I must try to explain it to you," he replied, smiling.
"I may tell you, since Markham has broached the subject,
that the poets have said that friendship is love in disguise,
but the dictionary gives it a more prosaic meaning. Let
us find it as it is in Webster."</p>

<p>"Webster?" stammeringly, and Mme. Lorraine looked
around with her disagreeably sarcastic laugh.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Van Zandt, you bewilder my little savage.
She can not read."</p>

<p>But a light of comprehension flashed instantly into the
puzzled eyes. She pulled Eliot's sleeve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean books. Come, you will find plenty in the
library."</p>

<p>He followed her into the pretty room beyond the olive
satin <i>portière</i>, where they found plenty of books indeed.
She pointed to them, and looked at him helplessly.</p>

<p>He found Webster on the top shelf of a rich inlaid book-case,
and was half-stifled with dust as he drew it down
from the spot where it had rested undisturbed for years.
He sneezed vigorously, and his companion hastened to
dust it off with her tiny handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Now!" she said, anxiously, spreading the big book
open on a table before him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>The leaves fluttered with her hasty movement, and a
folded sheet of parchment fell out upon the floor. As he
turned the pages to the F's she picked up the paper and
held it in her hands, looking curiously at the bold, clear
superscription on the back, and the big red seal; but it
told nothing to her uneducated eyes, and with an unconscious
sigh, she pushed it back into the dictionary, her
hand touching his in the movement and sending an odd
thrill of pleasure along his nerves.</p>

<p>He read aloud, in his clear, full tones:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Friend</span>.&mdash;One who, entertaining for another sentiments
of esteem, respect, and affection, from personal predilection,
seeks his society and welfare; a well-wisher, an
intimate associate.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>She stood by him, her hands resting on the table, trembling
with pleasure, her face glowing.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," she exclaimed. "I thought the word
sounded very sweet. And&mdash;you&mdash;you want to be my
friend?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The most finished coquette might have envied the artless
naïveté of her look and tone, yet she was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Too innocent for coquetry,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Too fond for idle scorning."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Touched by this new side of her character, he put his
hand impulsively on the little one resting close by his on
the table with a gentle pressure.</p>

<p>"Child, I will be your friend if you will let me," he
said, in a gentle tone, and not dreaming of all to which
that promise was swiftly leading.</p>

<p>"I shall be so glad," she said, in a voice so humble,
and with so tender a face, that the people in the other
room would scarce have recognized her as the little savage
and vixen they called her.</p>

<p>But Pierre Carmontelle, always full of mischief and banter,
had deliberately sauntered in, and heard the compact
of friendship between the two who, until to-night, had
been utter strangers. He gave his friend a quizzical
smile.</p>

<p>"Ever heard of Moore's 'Temple to Friendship,' Van
Zandt?" he inquired, dryly. "Let me recall it to your
mind."</p>

<p>He brought a book from a stand near by, opened it, and
read aloud, with dry significance, in his clear voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'A Temple to Friendship,' said Laura, enchanted,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'I'll build in this garden&mdash;the thought is divine!'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her temple was built, and she now only wanted<br /></span>
<span class="i4">An image of Friendship to place on the shrine.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She flew to a sculptor who sat down before her<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A Friendship the fairest his art could invent;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But so cold and so dull that the youthful adorer<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Saw plainly this was not the idol she meant.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Oh, never!' she cried, 'could I think of enshrining<br /></span>
<span class="i4">An image whose looks are so joyless and dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But you, little god, upon roses reclining,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">We'll make, if you please sir, a Friendship of him.'<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<span class="i2">So the bargain was struck; with the little god laden,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">She joyfully flew to her shrine in the grove;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Farewell,' said the sculptor, 'you're not the first maiden<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who came but for Friendship and took away Love!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He shut the book and laughed, for he had the satisfaction
of seeing a warm flush mount to the temples of the
young journalist, but the girl, so young, so ignorant, so
strangely beautiful, looked at him unabashed. Evidently
she knew no more of love than she did of friendship.
They were alike meaningless terms to her uncultured
mind. Frowning impatiently, she said:</p>

<p>"Carmontelle, why did you intrude upon us here? I
wanted to talk to Monsieur Van Zandt."</p>

<p>"And I, ma'amselle, wanted to talk to you. Madame
Lorraine was very angry with you for racing Selim to-day.
What did she do to you?"</p>

<p>The large eyes brightened angrily, and a hot rose-flush
broke through the creamy pallor of her oval cheek.</p>

<p>"Beat me!" she said, bitterly.</p>

<p>"No!" from both men in a shocked tone.</p>

<p>"But yes," she replied, with a sudden return of sullenness.
With a swift movement she drew the mass of hair
from her white shoulders, which she pushed up out of her
low dress with a childish movement.</p>

<p>"Look at the marks on my back," she said.</p>

<p>They did look, and shuddered at the sight. The thick
tresses of hair had hidden the long, livid marks of a cruel
lash on the white flesh. There were a dozen or so of
stripes, and the flesh was cut in some places till the blood
had oozed through.</p>

<p>The girl's eyes flashed, and she clinched her little hands
tightly.</p>

<p>"I hate that woman!" she muttered, fiercely. "Oh,
it is cruel, cruel, to be nobody, to have no one but her, to
be nothing but a pretty plaything, as she calls me, like
her Spitz and her cat, her parrot and monkey! I mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
to run away. It was for that I rode to-day&mdash;to win the
gold&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;what?" said Van Zandt, huskily.</p>

<p>She answered with passionate pride:</p>

<p>"When she beat me&mdash;when she flung my poverty in my
face&mdash;when she said I should be starving but for her bread&mdash;I
flung the purse of gold down at her feet&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;pay!"</p>

<p>The hard glitter of the dark eyes dissolved in quick
tears. She dropped the golden tresses back on her lacerated
shoulders, flung her arms before her face, and hard,
choking sobs shook the slight, young form. The two men
gazed on her, pale, moved, speechless.</p>

<p>Eliot Van Zandt thought of his fair, young sisters,
scarcely older than this girl, on whose lovely frames the
winds of heaven were scarce permitted to blow roughly.
Why, if any one had struck Maud or Edith such a blow,
he should have sent a bullet through his heart, so fierce
would be his anger.</p>

<p>He looked at Carmontelle.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lorraine&mdash;does he permit this?" he asked,
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Lorraine had been in a mad-house fourteen years&mdash;sent
there by the madness of jealousy," was the unexpected
reply.</p>

<p>Madame's gay, shrill laugh rang out from the salon
where she was winning golden eagles from her friends.
The journalist shuddered and wondered if the brilliant
woman ever remembered the man gone insane for her
sake.</p>

<p>Ma'amselle's hard, bitter sobs ceased suddenly as they
had begun. She dashed the tears from her eyes, and said,
with bitter resignation:</p>

<p>"<i>N'importe</i>! It is not the first time&mdash;perhaps it may
not be the last. But, <i>mon Dieu</i>, it is better to be only her
plaything, petted one moment, whipped the next, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
does her mischievous monkey and snarling puppy. She
says she should make me live in the kitchen if I were ugly
instead of being so pretty. She wants everything about
her to be pretty. But, say nothing of all this, you two,"
lifting a warning taper finger. "It could do no good&mdash;she
would only beat me more."</p>

<p>"Too true!" assented Pierre Carmontelle, sadly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>They returned to the salon, and Mme. Lorraine flung
down her cards and arose.</p>

<p>"Messieurs, I will give you your revenge another time.
Now I must give some attention to my Northern friend.
Come, Monsieur Van Zandt, let me show you my garden
by moonlight."</p>

<p>She slipped her hand through his arm and led him
through a side-door and out into a tropical garden bathed
in a full flood of summer moonlight. Carmontelle drew
Little Nobody out by the hand. Markham and Remond
followed.</p>

<p>To Van Zandt's unaccustomed eyes the scene was full
of weird, delicious splendor. Fountains sparkled in the
moonlight, watering the stems of tall, graceful palm-trees
and massive live-oaks, whose gigantic branches were draped
in wide, trailing banners of funereal-gray moss. Immense
green ferns bordered the basins of the fountains, white
lilies nodded on tall, leafy stems, roses vied with orange-blossoms
in filling the air with fragrance, and passion-flowers
climbed tall trellies and flung their large flowers
lavishly to the breeze. Madame, with her jeweled hand
clinging to Van Zandt's arm, her jewels gleaming, walked
along the graveled paths in advance of the rest, talking to
him in her gay fashion that was odd and enchanting from
its pretty mixture of broken French and English, interlarded
here and there with a Spanish phrase. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
bent on subduing the heart of the young journalist, his
coldness and indifference having roused her to a fatal
pique and interest&mdash;fatal because her love was like the
poisonous upas-tree, blighting all that it touched.</p>

<p>She had brought him out here for a purpose. In the
soft, delusive moonlight she looked fair and young as a
woman of twenty, and here she could weave her Circean
spells the best. She became soft and sentimental with her
light badinage. Bits of poetry flowed over the crimson
lips, the dark eyes were raised to his often, coyly and
sweetly, the jeweled hand slipped until her throbbing wrist
rested lightly on his. Every gracious, cunning art of
coquetry was employed, and the victim seemed very willing
indeed to be won.</p>

<p>But when they bantered him next day he laughed with
the rest.</p>

<p>"<i>Ad nauseam</i>!" he replied, boldly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But he went again that night to Esplanade Street, drawn
by an indefinable power to the presence of the cruel, beautiful
woman and her fawn-like, lovely dependent.</p>

<p>"Madame Lorraine was engaged, but she would come
to him soon," said the sleek page who admitted him to
the salon, which a quick glance showed him was quite deserted.</p>

<p>He waited awhile, then grew weary of the stillness and
silence, and went out through the open side-door into the
charming garden.</p>

<p>The quiet walks gave back no echo of his firm tread as
he paused and threw himself upon a rustic bench beside a
tinkling fountain, but presently from beyond the great
live-oak with its gray moss drapery there came to him the
sound of a clear, sweet voice.</p>

<p>"The little ma'amselle," he thought, at first, and
deemed it no harm to listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a bargain, then, monsieur. You take the girl,
and I am a thousand dollars richer. <i>Ciel</i>! but what a
rare revenge I shall have for yesterday;" and Mme. Lorraine's
low laugh, not sweet and coquettish now, but full
of cruel venom, rang out on the evening air.</p>

<p>The night was warm, but Eliot Van Zandt shuddered
through all his strong, proud frame, as the voice of
Remond answered:</p>

<p>"Revenge&mdash;ha! ha! Mine shall be gained, too. How
I hate and love the little savage in one breath, and I have
sworn she shall pay for that slipper flung in my face. It
is a costly price, but to gratify love and hate alike I will
not stop at the cost."</p>

<p>"You are right. Once I refused when you asked for
her because I prized my pretty, innocent, ignorant toy.
But yesterday the fires of hell were kindled in my breast.
She is no longer a child. When she rode Selim there
amid the plaudits of thousands, she became my rival, hated
and dreaded, and I swore she should pay for her triumph
at bitter cost. Last night did you see her with Van Zandt,
her sly coquetry, her open preference? In her sleep, as
she lay coiled on her cot, she murmured his name and
smiled. It was enough. I swore I would hesitate no
longer. I would give you your will."</p>

<p>Rooted to his seat with horror, Van Zandt sat speechless,
his blood curdling at Remond's demoniac laugh.</p>

<p>"You have a <i>penchant</i> for the quill-driver?" scoffingly
said the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"He is a new sensation. His indifference piques me to
conquer him"&mdash;carelessly; "but to the point. I will
drug her to sleep to-night, and you shall carry her off.
Bring a carriage at midnight&mdash;all shall be ready."</p>

<p>"Done! But when they ask for her&mdash;for the Jockey
Club has gone wild with admiration over the little vixen&mdash;what
can you say?"</p>

<p>"I overheard her last night threatening to run away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
She was in the library with Carmontelle and the Yankee.
What more easy than to say she has carried out her
threat?"</p>

<p>Their low, jubilant laughter echoed in the young journalist's
ear like the mirth of fiends. There was a promise
of money that night, injunctions of caution and secrecy;
then the conspirators swept away toward the house, and
Van Zandt remained there, in the shadowy night, unseen,
unsuspected, brooding over what he had heard uttered behind
the drooping veil of long, gray moss.</p>

<p>Carmontelle had said, laughingly, that a visit to madame
and her little savage would furnish a spicy paragraph for
his paper. He thought, grimly, that here was the item
with a vengeance.</p>

<p>Oh! to think of that heartless woman and man, and of
the simple, ignorant, lovely child bartered to shame for
the sake of a fiendish revenge! The blood in his veins ran
hotly, as if turned to fire.</p>

<p>"My God! I must do something," he muttered, and
then started with a stifled cry of alarm.</p>

<p>From among the shrubberies close by something had
started up with a sobbing cry. It ran toward him, and
fell down at his feet; it was poor Little Nobody.</p>

<p>"You have heard? I saw you when you came!" she
gasped, wildly.</p>

<p>"Yes, poor child!" he answered.</p>

<p>"Sold! sold, like a slave, to the man I hate!" she
cried, fearfully, her dark eyes distended in terror. "Oh,
monsieur, he kissed me once, and I hated his kiss worse
than madame's blow. I flung my slipper in his face, and
he swore revenge. Once in his power, he would murder
me. Oh, you promised to be my friend"&mdash;wildly&mdash;"save
me! save me now!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>It was a strange, picturesque scene there in the starlit
garden, with its stately palms, its immense rough cactuses,
its fountains, and flowers. The man sat there with doubt,
trouble, and sympathy looking out of his frank eyes at the
girl who knelt before him, her delicate, tapering hands
pressed together, her white face looking up piteously, the
tears raining from her splendid eyes, and the long veil of
golden hair sweeping loosely about her slender form, that
passionate appeal thrilling over her crimson lips:</p>

<p>"Save me! save me!"</p>

<p>"Poor child, what can I do?" he uttered, almost unconsciously,
and she answered, wildly:</p>

<p>"Only tell me where to fly for refuge! I am dazed and
frightened. I know not where to go unless to the deep,
dark river, and fling myself in. But I do not want to die.
I only want to get away from this terrible place to some
happier spot! Ah! <i>certainement, le bon Dieu</i> sent you
here, monsieur, to help me, to save me!"</p>

<p>All her trust was in him, all her confidence. He had
promised to be her friend, and in a simplicity and innocence
as complete as a child's, she claimed his promise.
Nay, more, she claimed that God had sent him to her aid
in this dark hour of distress.</p>

<p>His mind was a chaos of contending emotions. That
he must help her he had decided already in his mind. But
how?</p>

<p>No answer presented itself to the vexing question. His
thoughts were in such a tumult that clear, coherent thinking
was an impossibility.</p>

<p>A moment, and he said, gently:</p>

<p>"Yes, I will help you, my child. I were less than man
could I let this thing go on and make no attempt to rescue
you from so dark a fate. But&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused, and she waited anxiously with her straining
gaze fixed on his troubled face.</p>

<p>"But," he went on slowly, "I can not see my way
clear yet; I must think, must decide. And it is not safe
to remain out here longer. They may come out here and
find me at any moment. Little one, can you trust me to
go away and think it all over, and then come back to
you?"</p>

<p>A moment of silence, then she rose and stood before
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will trust you," she said, gently; then,
with sudden desperation, "Should&mdash;should you not come
back I will never be taken by him. There&mdash;is&mdash;still&mdash;the&mdash;river!"</p>

<p>"Do not think of that," he said, quickly; "I will soon
return. Trust me wholly. Have I not promised to be
your friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," eagerly.</p>

<p>She put out her hands as if to clasp his arm, then suddenly
withdrew them. Frank and child-like as she was,
she was coy and shy as a fawn. She clasped her delicate
hands before her, and stood waiting.</p>

<p>"Now, tell me, is there not some way by which I can
gain the street without returning to the house?" said Van
Zandt.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur. Follow me," said the girl, turning
swiftly and going across the garden to a small gate in the
wall that opened on the street.</p>

<p>She turned a key in the lock and opened it wide as he
came up, thrusting shyly into his hand some dewy rosebuds
she had plucked from a vine that clambered to the
top of the wall.</p>

<p>"Do not fail me, <i>mon ami</i>," she breathed, softly.</p>

<p>"You can trust me," he said, again. "Now go back
to the garden or the house. Be as natural as you can.
Do not let them suspect your dangerous knowledge."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>She nodded her bright head wisely, and the next moment
he was out in the street, the gate shut against him,
alone with the thronging thoughts awakened by the occurrences
of the last hour. He pulled a cigar from his
breast-pocket, lighted it, and walked slowly along the wide
and almost deserted street, under the shade of the tall
trees that bordered the walk, his calmness gradually returning
under the influence of the narcotic weed.</p>

<p>Within the flowery garden the little ma'amselle, so
strangely lovely, so ignorant and innocent, with that
deadly peril menacing her young life, flung herself down
upon a garden-seat and gave herself up to impatient waiting
for the return of her knight, her brave Sir Galahad.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>Van Zandt had gone but a few squares, with his eyes
cast down and his mind very busy, before he stumbled up
against a man coming from an opposite direction. Both
being tall and strong, they recoiled with some force from
the shock, each muttering confused apologies.</p>

<p>But the next moment there was an exclamation:</p>

<p>"Van Zandt, upon my word!" cried the musical voice
of Pierre Carmontelle. "Why, man, what the deuce ails
you, to go butting up against a fellow in that striking
fashion?"</p>

<p>"Carmontelle!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;or, at least, what is left of him after your villainous
assault. Where were your eyes, <i>mon ami</i>, that you
run up against a fellow so recklessly? And where have
you been, anyway&mdash;to madame's?"</p>

<p>Eliot Van Zandt laughed at his friend's droll raillery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I have just come from Madame Lorraine's," he
said. "And I came away in a brown study, which accounts
for my not seeing you. And you&mdash;you were on
your way there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The word was spoken in a strange voice, and an odd
little laugh followed it. Then the big, handsome Louisianian
suddenly took hold of Van Zandt's arm, and said:</p>

<p>"Come, I have a great mind to make a confidant of
you. Let us go and sit down yonder in the square, and
smoke."</p>

<p>When they were seated, and puffing away at their
cigars, he began:</p>

<p>"The fact is, I was in a brown study, too, Van Zandt,
or I should not have run against you. I was going to
Madame Lorraine's, and I found myself thinking soberly,
seriously about the beautiful madame's wretched little
slave and foot-ball, the Little Nobody you saw there last
night."</p>

<p>"Yes," Van Zandt answered, with a quick start.</p>

<p>"By Heaven! it is a shame that the poor, pretty little
vixen has no friends to rescue her from her tormentor!"
exclaimed Carmontelle, vehemently. "For years this
cruelty has been going on, and the girl, with her immortal
soul, has been made a puppet by that charming, heartless
woman. Would you believe it, the girl has never been
given even the rudiments of an education? She is ignorant
as a little savage, with not even a name. Yet I have
seen this go on for years, in my careless fashion, without
an effort to help the child. I can not understand what
has roused me from my apathy, what has made me think
of her at last&mdash;ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>!"</p>

<p>This exclamation was called forth by some sudden inward
light. He went on, with a half-shamed laugh:</p>

<p>"What a speech I have made you, although I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
usually preach. Van Zandt, am I getting good, do you
think, or&mdash;have I fallen in love with that Little Nobody?"</p>

<p>There was a minute's pause, and Eliot Van Zandt took
the cigar from between his lips, and answered, quietly:</p>

<p>"In love, decidedly."</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu</i>!"</p>

<p>After that hurried exclamation there was a moment's
silence. Carmontelle broke it with an uneasy laugh.</p>

<p>"I am forty years old, but I suppose a man is never
too old to make a fool of himself," he said. "I believe
you are right, <i>mon ami</i>. I could not get the child out of
my head last night. I never noticed how pretty she was
before; and those lashes on her sweet, white shoulders. I
longed to kiss them, as children say, to make them well."</p>

<p>"Poor child!" said Van Zandt; and then, without preamble,
he blurted out the story of what had just happened.</p>

<p>Carmontelle listened with clinched hands and flashing
eyes, the veins standing out on his forehead like whip-cords.</p>

<p>"The fiend!" he muttered. "<i>Peste</i>! he was always a
sneak, always a villain at heart. More than once we have
wished him well out of the club. Now he shall be lashed
from the door, the double-dyed scoundrel! And she, the
deceitful madame, she could plan this horrid deed! She
is less than woman. She shall suffer, mark you, for her
sin."</p>

<p>"But the little ma'amselle, Carmontelle? What shall
we do to deliver her from her peril? Every passing moment
brings her doom nearer, yet I can think of nothing.
My brain seems dull and dazed."</p>

<p>"Do? Why, we shall take a carriage and bring her
away 'over the garden wall,'" replied Carmontelle,
lightly but emphatically.</p>

<p>"Very well; but&mdash;next?"</p>

<p>Carmontelle stared and repeated, in some bewilderment:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Next?"</p>

<p>Eliot Van Zandt explained:</p>

<p>"I mean, what shall we do when we have brought her
away? Where shall we find her a refuge and hiding-place
from her treacherous enemies?" anxiously.</p>

<p>"You cold-blooded, long-headed Yankee! I never
thought of that. I should have brought her away without
thinking of the future. But you are right. It is a question
that should be decided first. What, indeed, shall we
do with the girl?"</p>

<p>And for a moment they looked at each other, in the
starlight, almost helplessly.</p>

<p>Then Van Zandt said, questioningly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have relatives or friends with whom you
could place her? I am not rich, but I could spare enough
to educate this wronged child."</p>

<p>"I have not a relative in the world&mdash;not a friend I
could trust; nothing but oceans of money, so you may
keep yours. I'll spend some of mine in turning this little
savage into a Christian."</p>

<p>"You will take her to school, then, right away?" Van
Zandt went on, in his quiet, pertinacious way.</p>

<p>"Yes; and, by Jove, when she comes out, finished, I'll
marry her, Van Zandt! I will, upon my word!"</p>

<p>"If she will have you," laconically.</p>

<p>"<i>Peste</i>! what a fellow you are, to throw cold water
upon one. Perhaps you have designs upon her yourself?"</p>

<p>"Not in the face of your munificent intentions," carelessly.</p>

<p>"Very well; I shall consider her won, then, since you
are too generous to enter the lists against me. What a
magnificent beauty she will make when she has learned
her three R's!" laughingly. "But, come; shall we not
go at once to deliver our little friend from Castle Dangerous?"</p>

<p>They rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am glad I ran against you, Carmontelle. You have
straightened out the snarl that tangled my mind. Now
for our little stratagem. You will bring the carriage to
the end of the square, while I go back to the garden and
steal the bird away."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Carmontelle. "Oh, how they will
rage when they find the bird has flown! To-morrow the
club shall settle with Remond; for madame, she shall be
ostracised. We shall desert her in a body. Who would
have believed she would be so base?"</p>

<p>Van Zandt made no comment. He only said, as if
struck by a sudden thought:</p>

<p>"The poor child will have no clothes fit to wear away.
Can you find time, while getting a carriage, to buy a gray
dress, a long ulster, and a hat and veil?"</p>

<p>"Of course. What a fellow you are to think of things!
I should not have thought of such a thing; yet what school
would have received her in that white slip&mdash;picturesque,
but not much better than a ballet-dancer's skirts!" exclaimed
the lively Southerner. "You are a trump, Van
Zandt. Can you think of anything else as sensible?"</p>

<p>"Some fruit and bonbons to soothe her at school&mdash;that
is all," lightly, as they parted, one to return to Mme. Lorraine's,
the other to perfect the arrangements for checkmating
Remond's nefarious design.</p>

<p>Carmontelle was full of enthusiasm over the romantic
idea that had occurred so suddenly to his mind. A smile
curled his lips, as he walked away, thinking of dark-eyed
Little Nobody, and running over in his mind a score of
feminine cognomens, with one of which he meant to endow
the nameless girl.</p>

<p>"Constance, Marie, Helene, Angela, Therese, Maude,
Norine, Eugenie, etc.," ran his thoughts; but Eliot Van
Zandt's took a graver turn as he went back to the starlit
garden and the girl who believed him her Heaven-sent deliverer
from peril and danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is but little I can do; Carmontelle takes it all
out of my hands," he mused. "Perhaps it is better so;
he is rich, free."</p>

<p>A sigh that surprised himself, and he walked on a little
faster until he reached the gate by which he had left the
garden. Here he stopped, tapped softly, and waited.</p>

<p>But there was no reply to his knock, although he rapped
again. Evidently she had gone into the house.</p>

<p>"I shall have to go in," he thought, shrinking from
the encounter with the wicked madame and her partner in
villainy, M. Remond.</p>

<p>Madame was at the piano, Remond turning the leaves
of her music while she rendered a brilliant <i>morceau</i>. His
hasty glance around the room did not find the little
ma'amselle.</p>

<p>"She will be here presently," he decided, as he returned
with what grace he could Mme. Lorraine's effusive
greeting.</p>

<p>She was looking even lovelier than last night, in a costume
of silvery silk that looked like the shimmer of moonlight
on a lake. Her white throat rose from a mist of lace
clasped by a diamond star. In her rich puffs of dark hair
nestled white Niphetos roses shedding their delicate perfume
about her as she moved with languid grace. The
costume had been chosen for him. She had a fancy that
it would appeal to his sense of beauty and purity more
than her glowing robes of last night.</p>

<p>She was right. He started with surprise and pleasure
at the dazzling sight, but the admiration was quickly succeeded
by disgust.</p>

<p>"So beautiful, yet so wicked!" he said, to himself.</p>

<p>"You were singing. Pray go on," he said, forcing her
back to the piano.</p>

<p>It would be easier to sit and listen than to take part in
the conversation with his mind on the <i>qui vive</i> for the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of her he had come to save. He listened mechanically
to the sentimental Italian <i>chanson</i> madame chose,
but kept his eyes on the door, expecting every minute to
see a <i>petite</i> white form enter the silken portals.</p>

<p>Remond saw the watchfulness, and scowled with quick
malignity.</p>

<p>"Other eyes than mine watch for her coming," he
thought.</p>

<p>The song went on. The minutes waned. Van Zandt
furtively consulted his watch.</p>

<p>"Past ten. What if that wicked woman has already
forced her to retire?" he thought, in alarm, and the minutes
dragged like leaden weights.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could but slip into the garden. Perhaps she
is there still, fallen asleep like a child on the garden-seat."</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine's high, sweet voice broke suddenly in
upon his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you sing, I am sure. With those eyes it
were useless to deny it. You will favor us?"</p>

<p>He was about to refuse brusquely, when a thought came
to him. She would hear his voice, she would hasten to
him, and the message of hope must be whispered quickly
ere it was too late.</p>

<p>He saw Remond watching him with sarcastic eyes, and
said, indifferently:</p>

<p>"I can sing a little from a habit of helping my sisters
at home. And I belong to a glee club. If these scant
recommendations please you, I will make an effort to
alarm New Orleans with my voice."</p>

<p>"You need not decry your talents. I am sure you will
charm us," she said; and Van Zandt dropped indolently
upon the music-stool. His long, white fingers moved
softly among the keys, evoking a tender accompaniment
to one of Tennyson's sweetest love songs:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come hither, the dances are done.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Queen lily and rose in one;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To the flowers, and be their sun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'There has fallen a splendid tear<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From the passion-flower at the gate.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">She is coming, my life, my fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The red rose cries, "She is near, she is near,"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the white rose weeps, "She is late;"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The larkspur listens, "I hear, I hear,"<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the lily whispers, "<i>I wait</i>."'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The man and the woman looked at each other behind
his back. Remond wore a significant scowl; madame a
jealous sneer. It faded into a smile as he whirled around
on the music-stool and faced her with a look of feigned
adoration.</p>

<p>"Last night was so heavenly in the garden&mdash;let us go
out again," he said, almost consumed by impatience.</p>

<p>Time was going fast, and it lacked little more than an
hour to midnight. He chafed at the thought that Carmontelle
was waiting with the carriage, impatient, and
wondering at the strange delay.</p>

<p>"We will go into the garden," assented Mme. Lorraine.
"Ah, you cold-looking Yankee, you can be as sentimental
as a Southerner. Monsieur Remond, will you accompany
us?"</p>

<p>"Pardon; I will go home. I have no fancy for love
among the roses," with a covert sneer. "Madame, monsieur,
<i>bon soir</i>."</p>

<p>He bowed and was gone. Van Zandt drew a long
breath of dismay.</p>

<p>What if he should stumble upon Carmontelle and the
carriage waiting at the end of the square under cover of
the night?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>It was impossible to follow. Mme. Lorraine's white
hand clasping his arm, drew him out into the garden, with
its sweet odors, its silence, and dew.</p>

<p>His heart leaped with expectancy.</p>

<p>"I shall find her here asleep among the flowers, forgetful
of the dangers that encompass her young life."</p>

<p>He declared to Mme. Lorraine that he did not want to
miss a single beauty of the romantic old garden, and
dragged her remorselessly all over its length and breadth.
Perhaps she guessed his intent, but she made no sign. She
was bright, amiable, animated, all that a woman can be
who hopes to charm a man.</p>

<p>He scarcely heeded her, so frantically was he looking
everywhere for a crouching white form that he could not
find. There came to him suddenly a horrified remembrance
of her pathetic words:</p>

<p>"There is still the river!"</p>

<p>A bell somewhere in the distance chimed the half hour
in silvery tones. Only thirty minutes more to midnight!</p>

<p>With some incoherent excuse he tore himself away from
her, and dashing wildly out into the street, ran against
Pierre Carmontelle for the second time that night.</p>

<p>"I have waited for hours, and was just coming to seek
you. What does this mean?" he exclaimed, hoarsely.</p>

<p>A whispered explanation forced a smothered oath from
his lips.</p>

<p>"Be calm. There is but one way left us. We will
conceal ourselves near the door and wrest her from them
when they bring her out," said Eliot Van Zandt.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>But no place of concealment presented itself. The
broad pavement showed a long, unbroken space of moonlit
stone, save where one tall tree reared its stately height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
outside the curb-stone, and flung long, weird shadows
across the front of madame's house.</p>

<p>Carmontelle looked up and down the street, and shook
his head.</p>

<p>"I can see no hiding-place but the tree," he said.</p>

<p>"We need none better, unless you are too stout to scale
it," Van Zandt answered, coolly, turning a questioning
glance upon the rather corpulent form of his good-looking
companion.</p>

<p>"You will see," laughed the Southerner, softly.</p>

<p>He glanced up and down the street, and seeing no one
in sight, made a bound toward the tree, flung out his
arms, and scaled it with admirable agility, finding a very
comfortable seat among its low-growing branches. Van
Zandt followed his example with boyish ease, and they
were soon seated close to each other on the boughs of the
big tree, almost as comfortable as if they had been lounging
on the satin couches of madame's <i>recherché</i> salon. It
was delightful up there among the cool green leaves, with
the fresh wind blowing the perfume of madame's flowers
into their faces.</p>

<p>"I feel like a boy again," said the journalist, gayly.</p>

<p>"Softly; we are opposite the windows of madame's
chamber, I think," cautioned Carmontelle.</p>

<p>"She will not come up yet; she will wait in the salon
for Remond. It is but a few minutes to midnight."</p>

<p>A step approached, and they held their breath in excessive
caution.</p>

<p>It passed on&mdash;only a guardian of the peace pacing his
beat serenely, his brass buttons shining in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Van Zandt whispered:</p>

<p>"I am not sure but we should have invoked the aid of
the law in our trouble."</p>

<p>But Pierre Carmontelle shook his head.</p>

<p>"The law is too slow sometimes," he said. "We will
place the little girl in some safe refuge first, then, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Madame Lorraine attempts to make trouble, we will resort
to legal measures. I am not apprehensive of trouble on
that score, however, for madame really has no legal right
to the girl. Has she not declared scores of times that her
maid died, and left the child upon her hands, and that, only
for pity's sake, she would have sent her off to an orphan
asylum?"</p>

<p>Steps and voices came along the pavement&mdash;two roystering
lads, fresh from some festal scene, their steps unsteady
with wine. They passed out of sight noisily recounting
their triumph to each other. Then the echo of wheels in
the distance, "low on the sand, loud on the stone."</p>

<p>"Are you armed?" whispered the Louisianian, nervously.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The cold steel of a pistol pressed his hand.</p>

<p>"Take that; I brought two," whispered Carmontelle.
"We may need them. One of us must stand at bay,
while the other seizes and bears away the girl."</p>

<p>"It shall be I. I will cover your flight," Van Zandt
said, quietly.</p>

<p>Under his calm exterior was seething a tempest of wrath
and indignation that made him clutch the weapon in a
resolute grasp. He had pure and fair young sisters at
home. The thought of them made him feel more strongly
for madame's forlorn victim.</p>

<p>Their hearts leaped into their throats as Remond's close
carriage dashed into sight, whirled up to madame's door,
and stopped.</p>

<p>The door swung open, and Remond, muffled up to the
ears, sprung out and went up to the house.</p>

<p>Its portals opened as if by magic, with a swish of silken
robes in the hall. Madame herself had silently admitted
her co-conspirator.</p>

<p>Most fortunately the back of the carriage was toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the tree, and the driver's attention was concentrated upon
his restive horses.</p>

<p>Silently as shadows the two men slid down from their
novel hiding-place, tiptoed across the pavement, and took
up their grim station on either side the closed door.</p>

<p>Not a moment too soon!</p>

<p>At that very instant the door unclosed, and Remond appeared
upon the threshold bearing in his arms a slight,
inert figure wrapped in a long, dark cloak. Madame, still
in her diamonds, roses, and silvery drapery, appeared behind
him just in time to see a powerful form swoop down
upon Remond, wrest his prize from him, and make off
with wonderful celerity, considering the weight of the girlish
form in his arms.</p>

<p>She fell back with a cry of dismay.</p>

<p>"<i>Diable</i>! <i>Spies</i>!"</p>

<p>Remond had recoiled on the instant with a fierce oath
hissed in his beard&mdash;only an instant; then he dashed forward
in mad pursuit, only to be tripped by an outstretched
foot that flung him face downward on the hard pavement.</p>

<p>Scrambling up in hot haste, with the blood gushing
from his nostrils, he found his way barred by Eliot Van
Zandt.</p>

<p>"Back, villain! Your prey has escaped you!" the
young man cried, sternly.</p>

<p>A black and bitter oath escaped Remond, and his trembling
hand sought his belt.</p>

<p>He hissed savagely:</p>

<p>"Accursed spy! Your life shall answer for this!"</p>

<p>Then the long keen blade of a deadly knife flashed in
the moonlight. Simultaneously there was the flash and
report of a pistol. Both men fell at once to the ground,
and at the same moment there was a swish and rustle of
silvery silk, as beautiful Mme. Lorraine retreated from her
threshold, slamming and locking her door upon the sight
of the bloodshed of which she had been the cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let them kill each other, the fools, if they have no
more sense," she muttered, scornfully, heartlessly, as she
retired to her salon.</p>

<p>Remond's horses had been so frightened by the pistol-shot
that they had run off with their alarmed driver, who
had dropped the reins in the first moment of terror.
There now remained only two of the six souls present a
moment ago, Van Zandt and Remond lying silent where
they had fallen under the cold, white light of the moonlight.</p>

<p>But presently the Frenchman struggled slowly up to his
feet, and put his hand to his shoulder with a stifled curse.</p>

<p>"The dog has put a bullet through my shoulder.
Never mind, we are quits, for I ran my knife through his
heart," he muttered, hastening away from the scene of
bloodshed.</p>

<p>But Eliot Van Zandt lay still where he had fallen, with
his ghastly white face upturned to the sky, and the red
blood pouring in a torrent from the gaping wound in his
breast.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>Carmontelle made his way with what speed he could,
hampered as he was by the heavy, unconscious form of
the girl, to the carriage which he had in waiting at the end
of the square. His speed was not great enough, however,
to hinder him from hearing the sharp report of the pistol
as it went off in Van Zandt's hand, and a slight tremor
ran along his firm nerves.</p>

<p>"Somebody killed or wounded&mdash;and I pray it may be
Remond, the dastardly villain," he thought. "I should
not like for any harm to come to that noble young Van
Zandt."</p>

<p>Then he paused while the driver sprung down from the
box and opened the door for him. He laid his burden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
down upon a seat, sprung in, and then the door was
closed.</p>

<p>"To the Convent of Le Bon Berger," he said.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>, monsieur."</p>

<p>The man whipped up his horses, and they were off at a
spanking pace.</p>

<p>A happy thought had occurred to Carmontelle. He had
a friend who was the Mother Superior of the Convent of
the Good Shepherd. To her pious care he would confide
the poor, helpless lamb just rescued from the jaws of the
hungry wolf.</p>

<p>When the carriage had started off, he drew the thick
wrappings from the head of the unconscious girl and looked
at her face. It was deathly white, and the long, thick
fringe of her dark lashes lay heavily against her cheeks.
Her young bosom heaved with slow, faint respiration, but
he tried in vain to arouse her from the heavy stupor that
held her in its chains.</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine had been more clever than any one suspected.
She had given the drug to her victim in a cup of
tea, before she went out to the garden. Consequently the
narcotic was already working in her veins when she flung
herself at Van Zandt's feet, imploring his aid, and in a
very few minutes after he had left her she fell into a heavy
sleep upon the garden-seat, her last coherent thought being
of him who had promised to save her from the perils that
threatened her young life.</p>

<p>Carmontelle gazed with deep pity and strong emotion
on the piquant and exquisitely lovely face, realizing that
that beauty had well-nigh proved a fatal dower to the forlorn
girl.</p>

<p>Deep, strong emotion stirred the man's heart as he
gazed, and he vowed to himself that however friendless,
nameless, and lowly born was the girl, she should never
want a friend and protector again.</p>

<p>"I am rich and well-born, and she shall share all I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
have. When she leaves the Convent of Le Bon Berger, it
shall be as Madame Carmontelle, my loved and honored
wife, not the Little Nobody of to-night," he mused. "I
will teach her to love me in the years while she remains a
pupil at the convent."</p>

<p>In such thoughts as these the time passed quickly,
although the convent was several miles from Esplanade
Street, and in the suburbs of the city. At length the carriage
paused before the dark conventual walls and towers,
the driver sprung down from his seat and came to the door
with the announcement:</p>

<p>"Le Bon Berger."</p>

<p>"<i>Très bien</i>. Wait."</p>

<p>He drew a memorandum-book from an inner pocket,
and hastily penciled some lines upon a sheet of paper.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Madame la Superieure</span>,&mdash;Pardon this late intrusion,
and for God's dear sake admit me to a brief interview.
I have brought a poor, little helpless lamb to the
Good Shepherd.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Pierre Carmontelle.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Take that," he said, hastily folding it across. "Ring
the bell, and present it to the janitor. Tell him Madame
la Superieure must have it at once. Say I am waiting in
distress and impatience."</p>

<p>The man crossed the wide pave and rang the gate bell.
There was some little delay, then a stone slide slipped
from its place in the high gate, and the janitor's cross,
sleepy face appeared in the aperture. He was decidedly
averse to receiving Carmontelle's orders. It was against
the rules admitting visitors at this hour. The superior
had retired.</p>

<p>Carmontelle sprung hastily from the carriage and approached
him with a potent argument&mdash;perhaps a golden
one&mdash;for he took the note and disappeared, while the
Louisianian went back to his carriage to wait what seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
an inconceivably long space of time, restless and uneasy in
the doubts that began to assail his mind.</p>

<p>"If she refuses," he thought, in terror, and his senses
quailed at the thought. In all the wide city he could
think of no home that would receive his charge if the convent
turned her from its doors.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" he began to mutter to himself, in fierce
disquietude, when suddenly he heard the grating of a heavy
key in a huge lock, the falling of bolts and bars, and the
immense gate opened gingerly, affording a glimpse of the
janitor's face and form against the background of a garden
in riotous bloom, while beyond towered the massive convent
walls.</p>

<p>"<i>Entrez</i>," the man said, civilly; and Carmontelle seized
his still unconscious burden joyfully, and made haste to
obey.</p>

<p>The janitor uttered an exclamation of surprise when he
saw that strange burden, then he led the way, Carmontelle
eagerly following, until they reached the convent door. It
opened as if by an unseen power, and they went along a
cold, dimly lighted hall to a little reception-room where
two gentle, pale-faced nuns were waiting with the mother
superior to receive the midnight visitor. She was a tall,
graceful, sweet-faced woman as she stood between the two,
her slender white hands moving restlessly along the beads
of her rosary.</p>

<p>"My son," she uttered, in surprise, as he advanced and
laid the still form of Little Nobody down upon a low sofa,
drawing back the heavy cloak and showing what it hid&mdash;the
fair young girl in the loose, white slip, and the wealth
of ruddy, golden curls.</p>

<p>He looked up at her with a face strangely broken up
from its usual calm.</p>

<p>"Madame, holy mother, I have brought you a pupil,"
he said, "and I have to confide a strange story to your
keeping." He glanced at the sweet-faced, quiet nuns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
"Perhaps it were better to speak to you alone?" he said,
questioningly.</p>

<p>"No, you need not fear the presence of these gentle
sisters of the Good Shepherd. No secrets ever pass beyond
these walls," the mother superior answered, with grave,
calm dignity.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p>Carmontelle saw the three nuns looking apprehensively
at the pale, still face of his charge, and said, reassuringly:</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed. It is not death, although it looks
so much like it. The girl is only in a drugged sleep."</p>

<p>"But, monsieur&mdash;" began the mother superior, indignantly,
when she was interrupted by his equally indignant
disclaimer:</p>

<p>"It is none of my work. Wait until I tell you my
story."</p>

<p>And he immediately related it without reserve. All
three listened with eager interest.</p>

<p>"Now you know all," he said, at last, "and I will be
perfectly frank with you regarding my intentions. I am
rich, and have none to oppose my will. I wish to educate
this unfortunate girl and make her my wife."</p>

<p>The superioress was gracious enough to say that it was
a most laudable intention.</p>

<p>"You will aid me, then? You will receive her as a
pupil, train and educate her in a manner befitting the
position she will fill as my wife?" eagerly.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>, monsieur," she replied, instantly; and he nearly
overwhelmed her with thanks.</p>

<p>"I leave her in your care, then," he said, finally, as he
pressed a check for a large amount into her hand. "Now
I will not intrude upon you longer at this unseemly hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
but to-morrow I will call to see how she fares, and to make
arrangements."</p>

<p>He paused a minute to anxiously scan the pale, sweet,
sleeping face, and then hurried away, eager to learn how
Van Zandt had fared in his valiant effort at holding his
pursuer at bay. Springing into the carriage again, he
gave the order:</p>

<p>"Back to Esplanade Street."</p>

<p>The mettlesome horses trotted off at a lively pace
through the quiet, almost deserted streets, and in a short
space of time they drew up in front of Mme. Lorraine's
residence.</p>

<p>All was still and silent there. The front windows were
closed and dark, and the clear moonlight shone upon the
bare pavement&mdash;bare, where but a little while ago had lain
the forms of the two vanquished contestants.</p>

<p>Carmontelle looked at the dark, silent front of the house
for a moment in doubt and indecision. He felt intuitively
that behind its dark portals was the knowledge he desired,
that Mme. Lorraine could tell him how the contest had
fared after his departure.</p>

<p>Anxiety conquered his reluctance to arouse the household
at that late hour. He again left the carriage, and in
crossing the pavement to the door, slipped and fell in a
pool of blood yet wet and warm.</p>

<p>Horrified, he held up his hands with the dark fluid
dripping from them.</p>

<p>"So, then, blood has been shed!" he exclaimed, and
rang a furious peal on madame's door-bell.</p>

<p>"Whew! that was loud enough to wake the dead!"
ejaculated the attentive driver from his box; but apparently
Mme. Lorraine was a very sound sleeper indeed, for
repeated ringings of the bell elicited no response.</p>

<p>In despair, Carmontelle was forced to go away, although
quite satisfied in his own mind that Mme. Lorraine had
heard, but refused to respond through malice prepense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>He drove next to Eliot Van Zandt's hotel, and met the
startling information that the young man had not been in
that night.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! what has become of the brave lad?" he
ejaculated, in alarm; then, fiercely: "I will seek out
Remond, and force the truth from him at the point of my
sword!"</p>

<p>Fortunately for the now wearied horses, Remond's hotel
was but a few squares further; but here he met the puzzling
information that Remond had left an hour before,
having given up his rooms, and declared his intention of
not returning.</p>

<p>In the dim, strange light of the waning moon, Carmontelle
grew strangely pale.</p>

<p>"There is some mystery at the bottom of all this!" he
asserted.</p>

<p>But, baffled on every side in his efforts after information,
he concluded to give up the quest until day; so was
driven to his own lodgings in the pale glimmer of the
dawn-light that now began to break over the quaint old
city.</p>

<p>Weary and dispirited, with a vague presentiment of evil,
he flung himself on his bed, and a heavy stupor stole over
him, binding his faculties in a lethargic slumber from
which he did not arouse until the new day began to wax
toward its meridian.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p>He had given his valet no instructions to arouse him;
therefore the man let him sleep on uninterruptedly, thinking
that his master had been "making a night of it," in
the slang phrase that prevails among gay fellows. So,
when he awakened and rang his bell, the midday sunshine
followed François into the quiet chamber and elicited an
exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Diable</i>! François, why did you not call me?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur gave me no instructions," smoothly.</p>

<p>"True; but you should have aroused me anyhow, you
rascal!" irascibly. "Now, hurry up, and get me out of
this as quick as possible!"</p>

<p>His toilet completed, he swallowed a cup of coffee,
munched a few morsels of a roll, and was off&mdash;appetite
failing in his eagerness to get at Van Zandt. On his way
to the hotel he dropped in at the club. No information
was found there. Neither Van Zandt nor Remond had
been in the rooms since yesterday.</p>

<p>He hastened on to the journalist's modest hotel, only to
be confronted with the news that Eliot had not yet returned.
Since he had dined, at eight o'clock last evening,
he had not been seen by any one in the house. His room
had remained unoccupied since yesterday.</p>

<p>Carmontelle sickened and shuddered at thought of the
blood before madame's door last night.</p>

<p>"It is plain that Van Zandt was the one who was
wounded, since Remond was seen at his hotel last night
after the accident. Great heavens! what mystery is here?
Is he dead, the brave lad? and have they hidden his body
to conceal the crime? I must find out the truth and
avenge his death, poor boy!"</p>

<p>He flung himself again into his carriage and was driven
to that beautiful fiend's&mdash;to the home of the woman who
had so heartlessly plotted the ruin of the helpless, innocent
girl.</p>

<p>She was at home, looking cool, fair, and graceful in a
<i>recherché</i> morning-robe garnished with yards on yards of
creamy laces and lavender ribbons. She was twirling some
cards in her jeweled fingers.</p>

<p>"Ah, monsieur, I have cards to the reception at Trevor's
next week. Are you going? Perhaps you have come
to say that you will attend me there?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>The coquettish smile faded at the scowl he turned upon
her face.</p>

<p>"Madame, where is Van Zandt?" he blurted out,
brusquely.</p>

<p>It was no wonder she had been such a star upon the
dramatic stage. Her puzzled air, the wondering glance of
her bright, dark eyes, were perfect.</p>

<p>"Monsieur&mdash;Van Zandt!" she repeated, in gentle wonder.
"How should I know? I assure you he has not
been here since last night."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," impatiently. "But what happened to
him last night? Did Remond kill him here, at your door,
where I found the pool of blood when I came back to look
for him?"</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Ah, then it was you, monsieur, that carried off poor
Remond's bride?" with a low laugh of amusement.</p>

<p>"Answer my question, if you please, Madame Lorraine,"
sternly. "Tell me&mdash;did Remond kill our young Yankee
friend last night?"</p>

<p>Madame threw back her handsome head, and laughed
heartlessly.</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, how can I tell? When I saw the two fools
were fighting desperately, I ran in, locked my door, and
went to bed. <i>Mon Dieu</i>, I did not want to be a witness
in a murder trial!"</p>

<p>"And you did not peep out of the window?" cynically.</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi</i>, no! I was too frightened. I did not want to
see or hear! I put my head under the bed-clothes, and
went to sleep."</p>

<p>"Heartless woman! After you had caused all the mischief!"
indignantly.</p>

<p>"I deny it!" cried Mme. Lorraine, artlessly, fixing her
big, reproachful eyes on his face. "I can not understand
what all this fuss is about. I did but arrange a marriage
for my pretty ward, French-fashion, with Remond, rich, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
love with her, and a splendid <i>parti</i>. But the little rebel
pouted, flirted, and held him at bay till he was wild with
love and jealousy. She was romantic. I proposed that
he run off with her and win her heart by a <i>coup d'état</i>.
The priest was ready. All would have gone well but for
the cursed intermeddling of that sneaking Yankee. I hate
him! What did he have to do with her that he should
break off the match? Do you say Remond has killed
him?"</p>

<p>She had poured it all out in voluble French, protestingly,
and with an air of the completest innocence, but she
met only a furious frown.</p>

<p>"Madame, your airs of innocence are quite thrown
away," he replied. "Your treachery is known. You
would have sold that poor girl to a life that was worse
than death. Your bargain in the garden was overheard,"
sternly. "Do you know what you have brought upon
your head, traitress? Social ostracism and complete disgrace!
The Jockey Club that has upheld you by its notice
so many years, will desert you in a body. We can not
horsewhip you as we shall Remond, but we shall hold you
up to the scorn of the world."</p>

<p>"Mercy, monsieur!" she gasped, faintly, dropped her
face in her hands, and dissolved in tears.</p>

<p>He had expected that she would scorn him, defy him,
but this softer mood confounded him. He could not bear
a woman's tears.</p>

<p>He sat and watched her in silence a few minutes, fidgeting
restlessly, then said, curtly:</p>

<p>"Come, come, it is too late for tears unless they are
tears of repentance for your sin."</p>

<p>Madame flung up her hands with a tragic gesture.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, how cruelly I have been misunderstood! I
do not deny the plot in the garden, but the listener surely
did not hear all. Remond was to marry the girl, I swear
it! Poor little motherless lamb! do you think I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
have allowed any one to harm a hair of her head? Oh,
you wrong me bitterly! You have been deceived, misled."</p>

<p>She flung herself with sudden, inimitable grace on her
knees at his feet.</p>

<p>"Carmontelle, you should know me better than this!"
she cried. "I swear to you it was only a harmless plot
to make her Remond's wife. It would have been better
for her to have a home and protector, I&mdash;I am so poor,"
weeping, "I have lost so heavily at play that there is a
mortgage on my home, and I could not keep the girl much
longer; I must retrench my expenses. Yet only for
this I am to be ostracised, disgraced, held up to the scorn
of my friends. Ah, you are cruel, unjust to me. Oh,
spare me, spare me! Say nothing until you can prove
these charges true."</p>

<p>What a consummate actress! what a clever liar she was!
Doubt began to invade his mind. Had Van Zandt misunderstood
her words?</p>

<p>"Madame Lorraine," he said, sternly, "get up from
the floor and listen to me. I will give you the benefit of a
doubt. I will try to believe that your infamous plot went
no further than the trying to force that helpless child into
a hated union. Even that was infamy enough. Talk not
to me of your French marriages. I despise them. But I
will say nothing to the world&mdash;yet. I will not wrong you
until I make sure."</p>

<p>"Bless you, noble Carmontelle!" she cried, seizing his
hand and pressing passionate kisses upon it. He drew it
coldly away, and said, dryly:</p>

<p>"If you really feel grateful for my clemency, tell me
what you know about Van Zandt and Remond. I can not
find either one, and I fear that something terrible has happened
to the noble young Bostonian."</p>

<p>She swore by all the saints that she knew nothing, had
heard nothing since the pistol-shot last night.</p>

<p>"I was so frightened I did not wait to see who was shot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
I just ran in and went to bed. I did not want to be a witness
of anything so terrible!" she shuddered.</p>

<p>"You swear you are not deceiving me, madame?"
sternly.</p>

<p>"I swear by all the saints," fervently.</p>

<p>"Then I must search farther for my missing friend,"
he said, sadly, as he turned to go.</p>

<p>She caught his arm eagerly.</p>

<p>"Now tell me what you have done with the little baggage
who has caused all this trouble? By Heaven, Carmontelle,
if harm come to my little daughter through you,
I will hold you to account!"</p>

<p>"Daughter!" he echoed, bewilderly, and she answered,
dauntlessly:</p>

<p>"Yes, my daughter. The secret is out at last, the
secret of my shame! She was born before I met Lorraine.
Her father was&mdash;well, no matter who, since he was a villain.
Well, I put the child out to nurse, and made an
honest marriage. Then the woman followed me with the
child, and I had to invent a story to account for her to
Lorraine. Now I am free to claim her, and you see that
the law will support me in demanding her restoration to
my care!"</p>

<p>They stood looking at each other silently a moment,
then Carmontelle answered, angrily:</p>

<p>"Madame, I do not believe you. This is only one of a
dozen different stories you have told to account for the
possession of that child. Your last claim is made in order
to support a claim for her return to you. The pretext
will not avail you. The little ma'amselle is in safe hands,
where she shall remain until she is trained and educated
up to the standard necessary for my wife."</p>

<p>"Your wife?" she gasped, white with jealous fury.</p>

<p>"I have said it," he answered, coldly, and strode
abruptly from the house.</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine fell down for a moment on the sofa in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
furious hysterics. Carmontelle, her princely adorer, had
scorned, defied her; Van Zandt knew her guilt and despised
her; worst of all, the little scapegoat of her tempers, her
beautiful slave, the hated Little Nobody, had escaped her
clutches. Furies!</p>

<p>But suddenly she sprung up like a wild creature, tore
open the door that Carmontelle had slammed together,
and rushed after him. He was just entering his carriage
when her frantic hand arrested him and drew him forcibly
back.</p>

<p>"Come into the house; I must speak with you further.
Do not shake your head," wildly. "It is a matter of life
and death!"</p>

<p>He suffered her to drag him back into the salon. She
turned her shining eyes upon his face with a half-maniacal
gleam in them.</p>

<p>"The girl&mdash;had she awakened when you saw her last?"
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"No," he replied.</p>

<p>She smote her forehead fiercely with one ringed white
hand.</p>

<p>"My soul! I do not want to have murder on my hands.
You must find Remond. I gave him the little vial with
the antidote."</p>

<p>"The antidote?" he stammered, almost stupidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, the antidote. She is under the influence of a
strange drug. I bought the two vials long ago from an
old hag in the East as a curiosity, you see. One drug
was to bring sleep, the other to wake at will. Without&mdash;"
she paused, and her voice broke.</p>

<p>"Without&mdash;" he echoed, hoarsely; and in a frightened,
guilty voice, she muttered:</p>

<p>"The one, without the other means&mdash;death!"</p>

<p>"Fiend!" he hissed, fiercely.</p>

<p>"No, no; do not blame me. I meant no ill. I gave
Remond the antidote, to be used when they reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
end of their journey. How could I know you would take
the girl from him and hide her? How could I know he
would disappear? Find Remond quickly, or her death
will lie at your door."</p>

<p>"You speak the truth?" he cried, wildly.</p>

<p>"Before God and the angels, monsieur!"</p>

<p>With a smothered oath he thrust her from him and
rushed out again, leaped into the carriage, and gave his
orders:</p>

<p>"Like the wind, to the detective agency."</p>

<p>It was two miles distant, and the panting horses were
covered with foam when they set him down at his destination.
Fortunately the familiar face of the most skillful
detective in New Orleans looked at him in surprise from
the pavement. He beckoned him into the vehicle.</p>

<p>In words as brief and comprehensive as possible he explained
what he wanted done. He must find Remond at
once&mdash;find him and bring him to the Convent of Le Bon
Berger.</p>

<p>"A life hangs on his hands," he said, feverishly.
"Tell him not to fail to bring with him the antidote he
received last night."</p>

<p>"I will find him if he is in the city," the detective
promised, ardently; and full of zeal, inspired not only by
love for his profession, but genuine anxiety and grief over
the startling case just confided to him, he sprung from the
carriage to set about his task.</p>

<p>And Carmontelle, with his mind full of Little Nobody,
gave the order again:</p>

<p>"To the convent!"</p>

<p>He was possessed by the most torturing anxiety over his
little charge, and doubt over madame's startling assertion.</p>

<p>"Horrible! horrible! What possessed her to use a drug
so deadly?" he thought, wildly. "Oh, it can not be true!
I shall find her awake and waiting for me, the poor lamb!
Madame Lorraine only invented that story to torture me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>He spoke feverishly to the driver:</p>

<p>"Faster, faster!"</p>

<p>The man replied, in a conciliatory tone:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I dare not. I should be arrested for fast
driving, and your speed would be hindered, not helped, by
such a course."</p>

<p>He knew that it was true, and with a groan sunk back
in his seat and resigned himself with what patience he
could to the moderate pace of the horses. It seemed
hours, although it was but thirty minutes, before they
drew up again before the dark, grim building where he
had left his charge the night before.</p>

<p>The janitor admitted him without any parley this time;
but Carmontelle was so eager that he did not notice the
solemn, sympathetic look with which the man regarded
him. He rushed without delay to the presence of the
mother superior.</p>

<p>When she saw him, her countenance expressed the
greatest dismay. She crossed herself piously and ejaculated,
sorrowfully:</p>

<p>"Oh, monsieur, monsieur, you have come at last!"</p>

<p>"Madame, holy mother!" he cried, agitatedly, and
paused, unable to proceed further. Something in her
face and voice filled him with dread.</p>

<p>"Oh, my son!" she uttered, sorrowfully, and speech,
too, seemed to fail her. She regarded him in a pathetic
silence mixed with deep pity.</p>

<p>He made a great effort to speak, to overcome the horror
that bound him hand and foot. A terrible fear was upon
him. What if she had not wakened yet?</p>

<p>With that awful thought, he gasped and spoke:</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>! oh, holy Mother of Jesus, comfort
him!" cried the good nun, piously. She advanced and
touched him compassionately. "God help you, my poor
son. She&mdash;she&mdash;has not awakened&mdash;yet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned his pale, frightened face toward her.</p>

<p>"She sleeps?" he questioned, eagerly; and with a holy
compassion in her trembling voice, she replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, she sleeps&mdash;in Jesus."</p>

<p>"Dead?" he almost shrieked, and she answered,
solemnly:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She thought he was about to faint, his face grew so pale
and his form reeled so unsteadily; but he threw out one
hand and caught the back of a chair to sustain himself,
while a hollow groan came from his lips:</p>

<p>"Too late!"</p>

<p>With tears in her eyes, the good nun continued:</p>

<p>"The little girl never awakened from the deep sleep in
which you brought her here. We made every effort to
arouse her, but all in vain. She sunk deeper and deeper
into lethargy, her breathing growing fainter and fainter,
and at last it ceased altogether."</p>

<p>"When?" he questioned, huskily.</p>

<p>"Three hours ago," she replied.</p>

<p>If it had not been for her sacred presence, Carmontelle
would have broken into passionate execrations of the
wicked woman who had caused the death of that sweet
young girl. As it was, he stood before her dazed and
silent, almost stunned by the calamities that had befallen
him since last night.</p>

<p>Van Zandt had mysteriously disappeared, and Little
Nobody was dead. The one, he feared and dreaded, had
been murdered by Remond in his fury; the other lay dead,
the victim of Mme. Lorraine's cruel vengeance.</p>

<p>"Come," said the nun, breaking in on his bitter
thoughts; "she lies in the chapel. You will like to look
at her, monsieur."</p>

<p>He followed her silently, and the low, monotonous sound
of the chant for the dead came to his ears like a knell as
they went on along the narrow hall to the darkened chapel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
where the weeping nuns lay prostrate before the altar,
mumbling over the prayers for the dead, and an old,
white-haired priest in flowing robes bent over his book.
Carmontelle saw none of these. He had eyes for nothing
but that black-draped coffin before the altar, with wax-candles
burning at head and foot, shedding a pale, sepulchral
light on that fair young face and form that such a
little while ago had been full of life, and health, and vigor.</p>

<p>He stood like one turned to stone&mdash;speechless, breathless&mdash;gazing
at that exquisitely lovely face, so faultlessly
molded, and so beautiful even in the strange pallor of
death, with the dark lashes lying so heavily against the
cheeks and the lips closed in such a strange, sweet calm.</p>

<p>His heart swelled with love, and grief, and pity. Poor
child! she had had such a strange, desolate life, and she
had died without a name and without a friend, save for
him who stood beside her now, his face pale and moved,
as he looked upon her lying like a broken lily in her coffin,
with the strange, weird light sifting through the stained-glass
windows on her calm face, and the monotonous
chants and prayers making a solemn murmur through the
vaulted chapel.</p>

<p>"Is it death or heavy sleep?" he asked himself, with a
sudden throb of hope; and he touched reverently the little
hands that were crossed over a white lily the nuns had
lovingly placed there. Alas! they were icy cold! His
hope fled. "Too late! too late! If they find Remond, it
will be all in vain," he muttered, and the mother superior
looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>Impulsively he told her all, and the nuns, at their
prayers, murmured aves and paters more softly, that they
might listen; the old priest, with his head bent over his
book, lost not a word. It was a romance from that
wicked outer world from which the convent walls shut
them in, a breath of life and passion from the "bewildering
masquerade" of existence, where</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Strangers walk as friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And friends as strangers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where whispers overheard betray false hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the mazes of the crowd we chase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some form of loveliness that smiles and beckons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cheats us with fair words, only to leave us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mockery and a jest; maddened&mdash;confused&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not knowing friend from foe!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mother superior gazed with dilated eyes as he poured
out the moving story, clasped her long, white hands excitedly,
and shuddered with horror.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>! the wicked man! the cruel, heartless
woman!" she exclaimed. "Shall they not answer for this
crime?"</p>

<p>"Ay, before Heaven, they shall!" Pierre Carmontelle
vowed passionately, with his warm, living hand pressed
upon the chill, pulseless one of the nameless dead girl;
and in the years to come he kept that impulsive vow made
there in the presence of the living and the dead.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>To return to Mme. Lorraine the night when Eliot Van
Zandt lay like one dead before her door in a pool of his
own blood, deserted by the brutal Remond, who had left
him for dead upon the pavement.</p>

<p>She had peeped from the window as Carmontelle had
charged her with doing, although she had denied the accusation,
and she had beheld all that passed. If she had not
conceived a passion for Van Zandt, he might have perished,
for all she would have cared; but something of womanly
softness stole into her heart as she gazed, and she murmured:</p>

<p>"Can he be dead, or only in a deadly swoon? What if
I go and find out?"</p>

<p>Glancing up and down the street to make sure that no
one was in sight, she slipped out and knelt down by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
prostrate form. Pushing back his coat and vest, she laid
her hand over his heart.</p>

<p>"There is some faint pulse. He lives, he lives!" she
murmured, joyfully. "Now, now is my chance to act
the good Samaritan. I will take him into my house,
nurse him, tend him, and gratitude may win for me that
which beauty and fascination failed to conquer."</p>

<p>She hastily summoned a confidential servant, a woman
who had been in her employ many years, and the repository
of many strange secrets. Together they managed to
convey the wounded, unconscious man into the house,
although the domestic expostulated with every breath.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Mima. It is none of your business.
You have only to obey my orders," madame returned,
coolly. "The underground chamber, please. His presence
is to be kept a secret. You and I will have the care
of him&mdash;you are quite skillful enough, after your experience
as a hospital nurse during the war, to attend his
wound. He will be hidden here, while to the world he
will have mysteriously disappeared."</p>

<p>They laid him down on a couch in the wide hall, and
Mima took a lamp and went out.</p>

<p>Soon she returned, and stood before her mistress, huge,
and tall, and dark, with a malignant scowl on her homely
foreign face.</p>

<p>"Madame, your strange guest-chamber is ready," she
said, with curt sarcasm. "But this heavy body&mdash;how
shall we convey it down the stairs?"</p>

<p>"You are big and strong enough," Mme. Lorraine replied,
coolly. "You may go in front and carry his body;
I will follow with his pretty head in my arms."</p>

<p>And so, as if the fate that had stricken him down into
seeming death had not been dark enough, he was borne,
an unconscious prisoner, into an underground chamber
beneath Mme. Lorraine's house&mdash;a luxurious chamber,
richly furnished, but of whose presence no one was aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
save herself and this servant, for it was entered by a door
cleverly concealed among the oak panelings of the hall.
The light of day never entered this secret chamber. It
was illumined by a swinging-lamp, and the odor of dried
rose leaves from a jar of <i>pot-pourri</i> in one corner pleasantly
pervaded the air, dispelling some of the mustiness
and closeness inseparable from its underground situation.</p>

<p>They laid Van Zandt down upon a soft white bed, and
Mme. Lorraine said, coolly:</p>

<p>"Now, Mima, you may examine into the extent of his
wound."</p>

<p>The large, masculine-looking woman went to work in
quite a professional way on her unconscious patient, and
in a short time she looked around and said, to the great
relief of her mistress:</p>

<p>"It is an ugly wound, very near his heart, but not necessarily
a dangerous one, unless a fever sets in. He has
fainted from loss of blood, and I will dress the wound before
I attempt to revive him. You may go upstairs, for I
see you growing pale already at the sight of blood, and I
don't want you here fainting on my hands."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mima," said Mme. Lorraine, almost
meekly; for one of her weaknesses, which she shared in
common with most women, was that the sight of blood
always made her very sick and faint.</p>

<p>She staggered out of the close room, toiled feebly up
the stairs, and drank two glasses of wine to steady her
trembling nerves; then she extinguished the lights in the
house, and retired to her bed. She was still awake when
Carmontelle returned in quest of Eliot Van Zandt, and
she laughed in her sleeve at his furious, ineffectual peals
at the bell.</p>

<p>Stealing to the window, she drew back a fold of the
curtain and peered down at him, chuckling softly when
she saw him take his angry departure. Then she returned
to her silken couch, and slept soundly for hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun was high in the heavens when Mima's rough,
impatient hand shook her broad awake without ceremony.</p>

<p>"Are you going to sleep all day?" she demanded.
"You wouldn't if you knew what had happened. The
little one's gone. I can't find her in the house or the
grounds, and her bed ain't been slept in all night."</p>

<p>She gazed suspiciously into madame's startled face,
which was not so handsome now with the cosmetics washed
from it, and that frown wrinkling her brow. She repeated
Mima's word in apparently stupid amaze:</p>

<p>"Gone!"</p>

<p>"Yes, gone! Don't you know anything about it?
Ain't you had a hand in it?"</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine, sitting up in bed in her night-robe of
soft white linen, burst out, indignantly:</p>

<p>"Look here, Mima, don't make a fool of yourself. If
the girl's gone, it's none of my work. She threatened,
the last time I beat her, that she would run away, and I
suppose she's kept her word. I've noticed that some of
the men that come here were sweet on her, and she's gone
with one of them, no doubt."</p>

<p>Mima stood like one petrified, looking at her, when she
suddenly burst out again:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! perhaps she has taken Selim! Run, Mima,
to the stables. Oh, the little wretch!&mdash;if she dared&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mima interrupted, harshly:</p>

<p>"She has not taken your idol. I knew she was in the
habit of stealing him out for a wild canter sometimes, and
I ran to the stables when I missed her. Selim was there
all right, and the ponies, too."</p>

<p>"Then she has gone off with some of the men; she has
eloped, the little vixen, and may joy go with her! It is a
good riddance of bad rubbish," madame cried, in such
violent indignation that the servant's suspicions were disarmed.
Seeing the impression she had made, the wily ex-actress
went on: "I dare say that was the cause of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
shooting last night. I was awakened by the report of a
pistol, and jumped out of bed and ran to the window. I
saw a carriage in front of my door, and two men scuffling
on the pavement. Suddenly one fell to the ground; the
other jumped into the carriage and drove rapidly away.
No doubt the wicked little baggage was in the vehicle, and
the fight was over her. Let her go, the little nobody. I
shall make no effort to find her. But aren't you going to
give me my chocolate, when I'm so weak I can scarcely
speak?" pausing in her voluble tirade, and fixing a glance
of reproach on the servant's dark, stolid face.</p>

<p>Mima shrugged her broad shoulders sarcastically and
retired, and madame sprung out of bed, thrust her feet
into satin slippers, and huddled on an elaborate <i>robe de
chambre</i>.</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall have to dress myself now, having
deprived myself of my little maid's services to gratify my
desire for revenge," she muttered, half regretfully. "<i>Ciel</i>!
but she had deft fingers and a correct taste. I can not
replace her services by another, for the secrets of this old
house are not to be trusted to a stranger. Well, I am a
thousand dollars the richer, although Remond let the prize
slip through his fingers after he had paid the price. And
what a fortune it was that cast Van Zandt into my hands!
I have fallen in love with the beautiful boy. It is really
love, not the <i>penchant</i> I have entertained for a score of
others. Ah!" She paused in her soliloquy, for Mima
entered with a tray on which glistened the gold and silver
of a costly breakfast service, spread with delicate edibles.
"Your patient, Mima, how is he?" she queried, anxiously.</p>

<p>"He is doing well, and thinks he is in a hospital," said
the woman. "It is best to humor him in that delusion
for several days; for if he were to find out the truth now,
he would fret and chafe, and perhaps bring on the fever I
am anxious to avoid. So, madame, you would do well to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
stay out of the sick-room until he is well enough to bear
the news that he is a prisoner of love," sarcastically.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p>Carmontelle stood for many minutes gazing like one
dazed at the still and lovely features of the nameless dead
girl. He was stunned, as it were, by the magnitude of
this misfortune, and could only murmur over and over in
accents of pity and despair combined:</p>

<p>"Too late, too late, too late!"</p>

<p>At length he too flung himself down before the altar with
bowed head, although no prayers escaped his lips, for the
stupor of despair was upon him. She was dead, poor unfortunate
Little Nobody, and there was naught to pray for
now.</p>

<p>There the detective found him, two hours later, when
he came with news&mdash;news at once good and bad.</p>

<p>"I found Remond," he said. "He was about leaving
the city by the steamer 'Ellen Bayne.' As he was about
crossing the plank, I collared him and demanded the antidote.
He was startled at first, and glared at me fiercely,
then suddenly assumed a calmness that looked so much
like acquiescence that I was completely deceived. He put
his hand into his breast-pocket, and drew out a small vial
of colorless liquid. I thought he was going to give it to
me, and, thrown off my guard by his apparent coolness,
released him and stretched out my hand. The cunning
villain took instant advantage of my belief; he sprung
away from me across the gang-plank, which was instantly
drawn in, as the steamer was leaving the wharf. Standing
on the deck, he looked at me with the leer of a fiend and
immediately flung the vial into the river."</p>

<p>"The fiend!" Carmontelle said, hoarsely. "But it
matters not. She is already dead."</p>

<p>And he led the dismayed and disappointed detective to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the chapel, and showed him the silent sleeper there, with
the cool white lilies on her breast.</p>

<p>"How beautiful, how unfortunate!" murmured the
kind-hearted detective, in reverential awe. His profession
had made him familiar with all sorts of tragedies and sorrows,
but this one seemed to him as sad and pathetic as
any he had ever encountered. He looked with deep sympathy
upon the man beside him to whom the girl's death
was such a crushing blow, but words failed him. He
could only look his silent and sincere sympathy.</p>

<p>Suddenly there recurred to Carmontelle the remembrance
of Eliot Van Zandt, whose fate was still wrapped
in mystery.</p>

<p>"Come, we can do no good here now," he said, mournfully.
"The fiends have done their work too well. We
must try to get at the bottom of the mystery that enshrouds
the fate of my poor friend."</p>

<p>After promising the mother superior to return and
attend to the funeral obsequies of the dead girl, he went
away, taking the detective with him to assist in the inquiry
for the young journalist.</p>

<p>It did not seem possible that they could fail in this
search, but though the anxious quest was kept up for
many days and nights, not a single clew rewarded their
efforts. Eliot Van Zandt had disappeared as completely
as though an earthquake had opened and swallowed him
into the bosom of old mother earth.</p>

<p>The detective could form but one conclusion, which he
reluctantly imparted to his employer.</p>

<p>"The young man was most probably murdered that
night, and his corpse flung into the river, but no proofs
will ever be found implicating Remond as the murderer.
Nor is it likely that the Frenchman will ever turn up again
in New Orleans. Fearful of detection, he will go abroad
and plunge into new crimes befitting his evil nature, and
the disappearance of poor Van Zandt will most likely remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
forever upon the terrible list of unexplained disappearance
of human beings."</p>

<p>Days came and went, and it seemed as if he had uttered
a true prophecy.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a tomb in the convent cemetery had
received to its cold embrace the shrouded form of Mme.
Lorraine's beautiful victim, and the madame herself had
been apprised of the fact by a brief and bitter note from
Pierre Carmontelle.</p>

<p>"The victim of your malice is dead and in her untimely
grave," he wrote. "Remond has fled the city, and the
Jockey Club has been told the secret of your guilt and his.
They are wild with rage, but they spare you yet until they
can make sure of your guilt, and bring your crime home
to you. In the meantime, I tell you frankly that you are
under constant espionage, and the task of my life is to
avenge the death of poor little ma'amselle upon you and
that cowardly Frenchman. Look well to yourself, for
enemies encompass you and punishment awaits you."</p>

<p>Madame grew pale beneath her rouge, and twisted the
angry note nervously in her jeweled fingers.</p>

<p>"A frank enemy!" she muttered. "He gives me fair
warning. Like the deadly serpent, he gives forth his
venomous hiss before he stings. He is very kind. Forewarned
is forearmed, they say."</p>

<p>She reread it with a nervous contraction of her brows.</p>

<p>"So the little one is dead! I did not intend it, but&mdash;it
is better so. Fate has removed an incumbrance from my
path. Now for a call upon my guest, to electrify him
with my news. Mima says he is fast recovering, and that
I may venture upon a visit."</p>

<p>She went to her dressing-room and donned a street costume
of olive cashmere and silk, with bonnet and gloves
and all the paraphernalia of walking costume. Then,
with a choice bunch of flowers culled from her garden, she
let herself through the secret entrance to the cellar chamber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and preceded by the frowning servant, was ushered
into the presence of Eliot Van Zandt.</p>

<p>He lay, pale and handsome and restless, among the
white pillows in the luxurious room. The lamp that
burned night and day shed a soft, roseate glow over everything,
and brightened somewhat the pallid cast of his
countenance.</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur Van Zandt, my poor, dear Yankee
friend, the cruel doctors and nurses have permitted me to
call on you at last! And how do you find yourself this
evening, <i>mon ami</i>?" she cried, fluttering up to his bedside,
all smiles and sweet solicitude.</p>

<p>His dark-gray eyes opened wide with surprise and displeasure.</p>

<p>"Madame Lorraine!" he ejaculated, angrily, but she
pretended not to understand the surprise and anger.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I," she said, sweetly. "Did you think you
were deserted by all your friends? But it was the cruel
doctors in the hospital; they would admit no one until you
were out of danger. I came every day and begged until
they gave me leave to see you. Ah, <i>mon ami</i>, I have
suffered such anxiety for your sake!" with uplifted eyes
and pensive air. "But, thank the good God, you are restored
to me."</p>

<p>The dark-gray eyes flashed with resentment, and a warm
flush crept up to the young man's pale brow. He waved
her away indignantly.</p>

<p>"Madame Lorraine, your hypocrisy is intolerable!" he
exclaimed, hotly. "Leave me. Your call is in the worst
of taste, and most undesirable."</p>

<p>With impetuous grace, she flung herself down on her
knees beside him, surprise, dismay, and wounded love expressed
eloquently on her mobile face.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>mon ami</i>, what have I done to receive this repulse?
I come to you in friendship and regard, and you
order me away! Good nurse"&mdash;turning her head around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
for a moment to scornful Mima&mdash;"is it that your patient
is delirious yet, that he thus upbraids his truest friend?"</p>

<p>"Get up from your knees, Madame Lorraine; you can
not deceive me by your artful professions," Van Zandt
cried, sternly; and looking wondrously grand and handsome
in his anger, although he could scarcely lift his
blonde head from the pillow. "I am not delirious; my
mind is perfectly clear, and, in proof of it, listen: I was
in your garden that night, and heard your nefarious plotting
with Remond for the ruin of that poor young girl.
She heard, too, and, distracted with terror, begged me to
save her. It was I who brought Carmontelle to the rescue,
while I held at bay the villain Remond. Now you understand
why I loathe the sight of you&mdash;why I wish you to go
out from my presence, never to enter it again."</p>

<p>She wept and protested, as she had done with Carmontelle,
that it was all a cruel mistake. She had but made a
match, French-fashion, for her ward. Remond was
pledged to marry her that night. She did not find him
credulous, as she had hoped. He smiled in scorn, and
reiterated his wish that she should leave the room.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, bitterly, "I am going, but not
before I tell the news I brought; your officious intermeddling
was fatal to the girl you pretended to save&mdash;it
was the cause of her death."</p>

<p>"Death!" he echoed; and the fair, stately head fell
back among the pillows, the lids drooped over his eyes.
Mima believed he was about to swoon, and hastily brought
restoratives.</p>

<p>"You should have held your cursed tongue!" she muttered,
in an audible aside to her mistress; but Mme. Lorraine
did not reply. She was watching that deathly pale
face that looked up at her so eagerly as Van Zandt whispered,
faintly:</p>

<p>"Dead! Oh, you do but jest! It can not be!"</p>

<p>"It is no jest. It is the truth. Do you want to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
how it came about? Remond had two subtle Eastern
drugs, the one to induce heavy sleep, the other to awaken
her at his will. Well, you and Carmontelle interfered,
and so Remond ran away with the second drug, and&mdash;she
died in her sleep."</p>

<p>"No, no!" he cried, almost imploringly.</p>

<p>"Ah, you regret your work when too late!" madame
cried, triumphantly. "It is sad, is it not? But it is true
as Heaven. Barely an hour ago I received a note from
him, to say that she was dead and buried, the poor little
wretch!"</p>

<p>"It is your fiendish work!" he said, bitterly. "May
Heaven punish you! Ah, the poor innocent little ma'amselle,
it was hard for her to go like that. But&mdash;better
death than dishonor!"</p>

<p>He put his white hand up before his face, and a long,
deep, shuddering sigh shook him from head to foot.
Mima shook her mistress roughly by the shoulder and
pointed to the door that led up the stairs to the hidden
entrance.</p>

<p>"Go!" she whispered, harshly. "I don't know what
prompted you to this devil's work. You must have
wanted to kill him. I don't know how this will result
now. Go, and take your hateful face out of his sight!"</p>

<p>Madame flung down her roses with a whimper, and
trailed her rich robes from the room in a passion of disappointed
love and hope.</p>

<p>"He loved her&mdash;like the rest!" she muttered, fiercely.
"I wish she had died before he ever saw her. But I
swear I will win him yet, or&mdash;he shall never see the light
of day again!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>Van Zandt lay for a long time with his face hidden in
his hands, long, labored sighs shaking his manly form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
feeling as if a nightmare of horror had fastened itself upon
him. It had been bad enough to lie here, bound hand and
foot by the pain of his severe wound, and chafing fiercely
against his misfortune, but with the inward comfort of the
knowledge that by his bravery he had saved a girl, Little
Nobody though she was, from a cruel fate; but&mdash;now!</p>

<p>Now, at the sudden and cruel news Mme. Lorraine had
maliciously brought, his heart almost ceased its beating,
so awful was the shock.</p>

<p>Dead, gone out of life in her maiden bloom, so beautiful,
so innocent and ignorant, wronged irretrievably by a
woman without a heart&mdash;a handsome creature, wicked
enough to sell a young, immortal soul to ruin for a handful
of sordid gold! Bitter, sorrowful, indignant were his
meditations while he lay there, with his hand before his
face, watched furtively by the big, ugly Mima, who, with
all her rough ways, was a skillful and tender nurse, having
spent four years of her life caring for wounded soldiers in
an army hospital.</p>

<p>She moved nearer to him at last, and said, uneasily:</p>

<p>"Best not to take it so hard, sir. The girl's gone to a
better place than this wicked world, where she never saw
one happy day. You'll make yourself worse, taking on
like this, and it can't do any good to the dead, so cheer
up and think of getting well as fast as you can, and out of
this lonesome place."</p>

<p>He looked curiously at the hard, homely face as she
spoke, for she had been shy and taciturn heretofore, wasting
few words upon her patient. She had told him that
he was in a private hospital, and he had not doubted the
assertion, although, as days passed by, it seemed strange
to him that he saw no face but hers about him. Another
thing that puzzled him was, that it seemed always night
in his room&mdash;the curtains drawn and the lamp burning.
When he spoke of this to Mima, she answered abruptly
that he slept all day and lay awake all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I never see the doctor when he comes to visit
me," he added.</p>

<p>"You are always asleep when he pays his midday visit,"
she replied.</p>

<p>In the languor and pain of his illness he accepted all her
statements in good faith, although chafing against his
forced detention, and wondering what his publishers and
his home folks would think of his strange silence. He had
resolved only this morning that he would ask Carmontelle
to write to them for him to say that he was sick&mdash;not
wounded&mdash;only sick.</p>

<p>Now he looked fixedly at his strange, grim nurse, and
said, sternly:</p>

<p>"Never admit that woman, that fiend rather, into my
presence again. Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Mima replied, soothingly; and he continued,
anxiously:</p>

<p>"Now, tell me, has any one called to see me since I
was brought to this hospital? I mean, except that woman,
Madame Lorraine?"</p>

<p>"Lord, yes, sir; several gentlemen that said they was
from the Jockey Club, and friends of yours. But the
doctor's orders was strict not to admit anybody."</p>

<p>"How came Madame Lorraine to get admittance,
then?" with a very black frown.</p>

<p>"Lord, sir, she wheedled the doctor with her pretty
face!"</p>

<p>He frowned again, and said, peremptorily:</p>

<p>"When the doctor comes in again, you must awaken
me if I am asleep. I must speak to him."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," meekly.</p>

<p>"And if the gentlemen from the club come again, say
to the doctor that they must be admitted. I am quite
well enough to receive my friends, and I must get some
one to write home for me. Will you do as I tell you?"
looking at her with contracted brows, and a dark-red flush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
mounting into his cheek that alarmed her, experienced
nurse that she was.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my dear sir, I will do just as you say," she
replied, eager to pacify him, for she saw that what she
had been dreading all the time had come to pass, through
the imprudence of Mme. Lorraine&mdash;her patient had been
driven by excitement into a high fever.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p>In the meantime, a strange event had taken place at
the Convent of Le Bon Berger, through the curiosity of
the old priest, who, while bending over his book in the
chapel, had overheard Carmontelle's story of the mysterious
drug and its strange antidote. Although outwardly
absorbed in his devotions, he had listened with an excited
gleam in his dim old eyes, and once had half started forward
to speak, but checked himself quickly, and remained
quiescent during the time that elapsed before Carmontelle
and the praying nuns took their departure from the chapel.</p>

<p>When all were gone, and there remained only himself
and that still form in the black-draped coffin, he started
eagerly forward and stood in excited silence gazing at the
beautiful face of the dead girl. Once he lifted his old,
wrinkled hand and pressed hers tenderly, then withdrew
it, shuddering at that mortal coldness.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that the old priest had been excited
by the story of Carmontelle, for years ago he had been an
enthusiastic traveler in Eastern lands, and an old witch&mdash;or
sorceress, as she was called there&mdash;had given him two
drugs to which she ascribed the mysterious properties possessed
by those of which Carmontelle had spoken. He
had kept them always, certainly with no intention of ever
testing the strange power claimed for them, but only because
they were part and parcel of the box of curiosities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
he had brought with him from that fascinating tour. To-day
the two vials lay safely in the box, wrapped in a bit
of yellow parchment on which, in a strange tongue, were
inscribed the directions for their use.</p>

<p>It flashed over him that the hour had come when the
gift of the old hag, at whose strange leer he had shrunk
and shuddered, was to be instrumental in saving a human
life.</p>

<p>But he was old and wise, and he knew that life is not
always a blessing; that often and often it is but the bearing
of a heavy cross, with lagging steps and weary heart,
to a far Golgotha. In the dim confessional men and
women, and even the young and tender, had poured their
griefs and their sins into his compassionate hearing, and
many had waited for death with infinite yearning, while
some&mdash;and he trembled and crossed himself at the sad remembrance&mdash;had
gone mad over wrong and ruth, and in
despair had cut the Gordian knot of life. It was of all
this he had thought when he had restrained his impulse to
speak to Carmontelle; it was of this he was thinking now,
as he stood there, old and gray and holy, by the side of
that beautiful bud of life in the coffin.</p>

<p>He was, as it were, weighing entity and non-entity in
careful, metaphorical scales. He was solemnly asking
himself, "Which is better&mdash;life or death?"</p>

<p>From the saints and angels in that bright world beyond,
where his pious thoughts continually rested, seemed to
come a low, eager answer:</p>

<p>"Death!"</p>

<p>He looked again, with agonized doubt, at that fair,
lovely face, so innocent in its deep repose.</p>

<p>The mother superior had told him that the girl, had she
lived, was destined to be the bride of Carmontelle.</p>

<p>"I know the man&mdash;rich, generous, and worldly. As
his wife, she will be a society queen. Her idols will be
wealth and pleasure. She will be gay and heartless, forgetful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of all holy things, living only for this world. Better,
far better, the bride of Heaven."</p>

<p>And crossing himself again, with a muttered prayer he
went out of the little chapel, where presently the pale-faced
nuns came again, muttering their pious aves for the
dead.</p>

<p>That night in his cell, impelled by some irresistible force
within himself, he took out the small vial from the curiosity-box,
and read the strangely lettered parchment, for
he was an earnest student, and versed in Oriental lore.</p>

<p>Great drops of dew beaded his temples as he spelled out
the meaning of the parchment; and no wonder, for he read
there that, although one lay as dead for three days, a few
drops of the antidote poured between the lips would break
that deathly sleep and restore life; but after those wondrous
three days the drug could be of no avail&mdash;death must
surely ensue.</p>

<p>In the cold and cheerless cell the old priest shivered as
with a chill.</p>

<p>"What an awful responsibility lies upon me!" he muttered.
"It is for me to decide whether to give her back
to Carmontelle and the world, to be spoiled by its vanities,
or leave her soul, now pure and unspotted, free to enter
heaven."</p>

<p>After an hour of painful meditation he put away the
mysterious drug and spent the night upon his knees on
the cold stone floor of the cell, calling on all the saints to
uphold him in his pious resolve to save the soul of the
lovely girl by the sacrifice of her life.</p>

<p>And the next afternoon, in a shaken voice and a holy
resolve written on his ashen features, he read the long
Latin prayers for the dead to the assembled nuns and to
Carmontelle among them, and saw the form of poor Little
Nobody consigned to the grim vault in the convent cemetery.</p>

<p>Two days and a night had thus passed while the girl lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
in that death-like trance. A few hours more and the
prisoned soul would be separated from the body, and the
story of her brief life be ended.</p>

<p>But when the shades of night again fell on the convent
walls, a revulsion of feeling brought remorse to the soul
of the old priest. He was haunted by the thought of the
living girl prisoned in the vault among the dead. In the
solitude of his cell that night a strange unrest grew upon
him, and evil spirits seemed to people the gloom.</p>

<p>He started up in terror from his knees, the great drops
of sweat pouring over his face.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, it is murder!" he uttered, fearfully.
"Heaven put the means of saving her in my hands, and
I was too blind to understand. But I will atone, I will
atone!"</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to him, and he hurriedly sought
a brother priest and the mother superior. To them, in
deep humility, he confessed his error.</p>

<p>"I was deceived by tempting devils, but I see my mistake
in time to correct it," he said, humbly. "Several
hours yet remain of the time, and I will restore her to life,
by the aid of Heaven and this mysterious drug, and her
return to life must be a secret."</p>

<p>They went with him secretly to the dark vault. They
took from the coffin that unconscious form and bore it in
their arms to a secluded chamber. There they poured between
the pale, sealed lips a few drops of the mysterious
drug, and kept anxious vigil all night over her bedside.</p>

<p>In a few hours they began to reap the reward of their
solicitude. The appearance of the girl's face grew less
death-like, a delicate moisture appeared on her skin, a
faint color in her lips, and gradually a barely perceptible
respiration became apparent. The drug had done its restorative
work perfectly.</p>

<p>Down on his knees went the anxious old priest, and
he thanked Heaven for the life he had saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>When the morning light began to gild the convent spire,
the dark eyes opened slowly upon the face of the mother
superior, who was watching intently for this sign of life.
The priests had retired, and they were quite alone. Tears
of relief sparkled into the eyes of the good nun.</p>

<p>"Dear child, you are awake at last!" she exclaimed,
gladly; but the girl made no reply. Her lids had closed
again, and she had fallen into a quiet, natural sleep that
lasted until the chiming of the vesper bells.</p>

<p>She awoke to find her slumber guarded by another nun,
who had taken the place of the good mother. When the
dark, puzzled eyes wandered around the room, she chirped
sweetly:</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, you have slept so long, you must be
very, very hungry. I will bring you some food."</p>

<p>She came back presently with some light, nutritious
broth in a bowl, and fed the girl gently from a tea-spoon.
She swallowed languidly, and a few mouthfuls sufficed
her appetite. Then she looked at the pleasant-faced nun,
and said, languidly:</p>

<p>"Good sister, I do not understand. Just now I was
with Monsieur Van Zandt. He was wounded. Oh, how
pale he was!" shivering. "Another minute, and I am
here. How is it, and where is he?"</p>

<p>The old priest had entered noiselessly, and the low voice
was distinctly audible to his ears. He shuddered.</p>

<p>He had just read in a paper of the mysterious disappearance
of Eliot Van Zandt, who was supposed to have been
murdered, and his body flung into the lake or the river.
Hence the girl's strange words struck coldly on his senses.
He thought:</p>

<p>"Her soul has been parted from the body in that
strange trance, and has taken cognizance of the man
vainly sought for by friends and detectives. What if she
could tell where he is hidden!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Muttering a prayer for the girl, he came up to the bedside.</p>

<p>"Bless you, my daughter," he said, soothingly. "And
so you have seen Eliot Van Zandt? Does he yet live?"</p>

<p>She looked at him gently and with surprise. Perhaps,
in the strange experiences of her trance, she was inured to
surprises.</p>

<p>"Holy father," she murmured, reverentially, then,
gently. "I have seen him. He is not dead. He is not
going to die. But he is very ill; he is dangerously wounded."</p>

<p>The little nun chirped an "oh!" of vivacious wonder,
but the priest silenced her by a warning glance.</p>

<p>"Where is he? Where is Monsieur Van Zandt, my
daughter?" he questioned, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Where?" echoed Little Nobody. "Why, in the next
room, doubtless, good father, for a minute ago I was with
him, and then I found myself here so suddenly that it
seemed a little strange to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is strange," said the old priest, growing pale
and hurriedly crossing himself. "But you are mistaken.
He is not in this house. If you know where he is, tell
me, daughter."</p>

<p>She shut her eyes reflectively, opened them again, and
answered, dreamily:</p>

<p>"He was lying on a bed in a pretty room, where a lamp
was burning all day. There was a red wound on his
breast, and he was pale and ill. I do not know the house,
but Madame Lorraine can tell you, for it was her servant,
Mima, that I saw giving him a glass of water."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p>The nun looked at the old priest with round eyes of
wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father Quentin, what strange thing is this?" she
uttered, fearfully.</p>

<p>"Ask me not to explain it, my good daughter; it is a
manifestation of psychic power beyond human explanation,"
he replied, hastily quitting the room to seek the
mother superior.</p>

<p>As a result of his interview with her, he was soon on his
way toward Esplanade Street and Mme. Lorraine.</p>

<p>Seldom had the footsteps of such a holy man crossed the
threshold of the gay and volatile French woman. She grew
pale through her rouge and her powder when she read the
name upon his card, and sent word that she was not at
home.</p>

<p>He told the little page that he would wait until madame
returned, and took a seat in the quiet salon.</p>

<p>Angry and baffled, Mme. Lorraine came down to him.</p>

<p><i>"Bénedicité</i>, daughter," said Father Quentin; but she
looked at him inquiringly, without bending her lovely
head.</p>

<p>"I have come to see Eliot Van Zandt, who lies wounded
in your house," he said, boldly.</p>

<p>She gave a quick, nervous start, perfectly perceptible to
his eyes, and her glance sought his, full of frightened inquiry.</p>

<p>"The girl was right; he is hidden here," he thought,
with fluttering pulses; but aloud he said, with pretended
authority and outward calmness:</p>

<p>"Lead me to his presence; I must see the young man
at once."</p>

<p>She had recovered her calmness as quickly as she had
lost it.</p>

<p>"Holy father, you amaze me!" she exclaimed, haughtily.
"The man is not here. I read in my paper only
this morning that he had most mysteriously disappeared.
But come, I see you do not believe me. You shall search
my house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a little staggered by her assurance.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to seem intrusive," he said; "but my
informant was very positive."</p>

<p>Then he mentally shook himself. After all, he had no
authority for his assertion, except the strange words of a
girl who had just come out of a trance-like sleep&mdash;a girl
who might simply have dreamed it all.</p>

<p>But he followed her all over the pretty, elegantly appointed
house, the little page carrying the keys and unlocking
door after door until he was sure that not an
apartment in the house remained unvisited.</p>

<p>"You have a servant-woman, Mima," he said to her,
as they descended the stairs.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied; "Mima is in the kitchen, preparing
luncheon. You shall see her, too, holy father."</p>

<p>Mima, at work over a dainty luncheon, bowed her head
grimly to receive his blessing.</p>

<p>"You have been nursing a sick, a wounded man, Monsieur
Van Zandt," he said, trying to take her by surprise;
but she did not betray as much self-consciousness as her
mistress.</p>

<p>"The holy father mistakes; I am a cook, not a nurse,"
she replied, coolly.</p>

<p>And so he came away baffled, after all.</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine pressed a gold piece excitedly into the
hand of the little page.</p>

<p>"Follow the good priest, and come back and tell me
where he lives," she exclaimed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Father Quentin went his way immediately back to the
convent, with the story of his disappointment, and concluded
that Little Nobody's dream had been simply a
dream, with nothing supernatural about it. The light
that had seemed to shine momentarily on the mystery of
Eliot Van Zandt's fate went out in rayless darkness.</p>

<p>For the girl, she grew better and stronger daily, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
submitted, with child-like patience, to the innumerable
questions the good sisters asked her of her past life. They
were shocked when she told them the story of her life
with Mme. Lorraine, the life that she had counted of so
little value that she had never even given her little white
slave a name.</p>

<p>They went to Father Quentin with the shocking story&mdash;that
the girl had no name, and that that heartless woman
had called her Vixen, Savage, Baggage, Nobody, by turns.
She must be baptized immediately.</p>

<p>The good priest was as heartily scandalized as one could
wish. He chose a name at once for their charge. It was
the sweet, simple one, Marie.</p>

<p>And that same day, in the little chapel, surrounded by
the tearful nuns, Little Nobody stood before the altar and
received the baptismal name, Marie.</p>

<p>The next day she was formally introduced into the convent
school, which consisted of twenty young ladies, all
boarders. She was cautioned to say nothing of her past
life to her schoolmates. The priest said that she was a
ward of his, and he wished the pupils to be very kind to
Mlle. Marie, who, through the peculiar circumstances of
her life, had not received necessary mental culture, and
must now begin the rudiments of her education.</p>

<p>For downright, honest, uncompromising curiosity and
rudeness, no class of human beings transcends the modern
school-girl. The pupils of Le Bon Berger immediately set
themselves to work to torture the new scholar&mdash;the little
ignoramus, as they dubbed her. Such ignorance as this
they had never encountered before. They teased and
chaffed her in their audacious fashion, and speedily made
her understand her humiliation&mdash;a great girl of fifteen or
sixteen beginning to learn her alphabet like a child of five
years!</p>

<p>She was used to being chaffed and despised, poor Little
Nobody! It was the life at Mme. Loraine's over again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and the great dark eyes flashed in sullen scorn as they did
then, and the small hands clinched themselves at her sides
in impotent pain.</p>

<p>"I shall run away from here!" she thought, bitterly.</p>

<p>They had one habit with which they daily demonstrated
to her their superior wisdom. At recess they would assemble
in a great group and read aloud from the daily newspaper.
Sitting apart under the great trees of the convent
garden, the new pupil listened, against her will, to every
word, and so there came to her one day, through this
strange means, the news of Eliot Van Zandt's strange disappearance
from the ranks of the living.</p>

<p>With dilated eyes, parted lips and wildly throbbing
heart she listened, and when the reader's voice came to an
end, the group was electrified by a spring and a rush and
a vision of golden hair flying on the wind, as the new
pupil flew, with the speed of an Atalanta, into the presence
of the mother superior.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with Mademoiselle Marie? has she
got a fit?" exclaimed the merry, mischievous school-girls.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>


<p>Little Nobody had flung down the spelling-book that
had become her constant companion, and rushed impetuously
to the presence of the good mother superior.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more she had wrested from the gentle
nun her whole story, from the hour when Carmontelle had
brought her to the convent until now, when, through the
fanaticism of Father Quentin, she was as one dead to the
world outside, her young life solemnly devoted to Heaven.</p>

<p>The dark eyes flashed indignantly, the pale cheeks crimsoned
with anger.</p>

<p>"How dared he?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Daughter!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>The gently remonstrating tone had no effect on the excited
girl. She continued, angrily:</p>

<p>"Do you not see that it was wicked to shut me up for
life? I do not want to be a nun. I will not be a nun! I
tell you frankly their pale faces and black dresses give me
the horrors! I shall leave here at once to find the poor
Yankee that was wounded in defending me. He is in the
power of Madame Lorraine, I am sure. I dreamed of
him, and he was wounded, and in the care of Mima, her
servant."</p>

<p>The nun assured her that Father Quentin had been
already to Esplanade Street, and that Mme. Lorraine and
her servant had declared their ignorance of the journalist's
whereabouts.</p>

<p>Mlle. Marie's lip curled in unmitigated scorn.</p>

<p>"As if their words could be taken for truth," she
uttered, bitterly. "Ah, I know her falsehoods too well."</p>

<p>The nun knew not what to do. The demand of the girl
to leave the convent frightened her. She was compelled
to falter a refusal.</p>

<p>Then Marie flatly rebelled. Some of the spirit that had
made Remond call her a little savage flashed into her eyes,
and she vowed that she would not be detained.</p>

<p>The mother went hastily to call Father Quentin. He
firmly refused to grant the girl's wish. He was persuaded
that to do so would be to insure her own eternal ruin.</p>

<p>The passionate heart, the undisciplined temper, took
fire at his flat refusal.</p>

<p>To the poor girl it seemed that the whole world was
arrayed against her.</p>

<p>Why had the old priest saved her from death if she was
to be immured forever, as in a living tomb, in this grim old
convent? The sanguine youth and hope within her rose
up in passionate protest.</p>

<p>She pleaded, and when entreaty failed, she flung down a
passionate defiance. Go she would! Eliot Van Zandt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
needed her to deliver him from Mme. Lorraine's baneful
power. Should she torture him, destroy him, while she
who owed him so much forsook him? Ah, no, no!</p>

<p>The result was that the defiant, contumacious pupil was
consigned to solitary confinement in a cell for the remainder
of the day, until she should come to her senses and ask
pardon of the priest and the good mother superior.</p>

<p>She flung herself down, sobbing, on the cold stone floor,
too angry to repeat the prayers Father Quentin had recommended
her to address to the saints. Her thoughts centered
around Eliot Van Zandt in agonizing solicitude.</p>

<p>"He was my friend; he fought Remond to save me,"
she murmured; "and shall I desert him in the danger he
incurred for my sake? Never, never! not if to find him I
have to venture back into the spider's den, into madame's
presence again."</p>

<p>Day waned and faded, and the soft chiming of the vesper
bells rang out the hour of her release. Pale and
watchful, she knelt among the nuns and the pupils in the
chapel, but ere the Aves and the Pater Nosters were over,
she had flitted like a shadow from the cloister, and in
"the dim, religious light" made her way into the garden,
having first secured her hat and cloak from a convenient
rack. Breathless she made her hurried way through the
thick, dark shrubberies, praying now that Heaven would
aid her to escape from the half-insane old priest.</p>

<p>"Where there's a will there's a way." Desperation
had made her bold and reckless. But one means of escape
presented itself, and that was to scale the high stone wall
with the bristling spikes on top. By the aid of convenient
shrubberies she accomplished the feat, and, with bleeding
hands and torn garments, dropped down upon the other
side into the street.</p>

<p>Fortunately, no one was passing, so her escape remained
unnoticed. Panting for breath, in her eagerness she ran
the length of a square and turned down a corner, losing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
herself in a labyrinth of streets. She knew not where she
was; but that did not matter yet. She was only intent on
putting the greatest possible distance between herself and
the convent where she had been so nearly immured for life.</p>

<p>After an hour's rapid walking through a locality of
which she was totally ignorant, she came suddenly into a
street with which she was familiar. From this she knew
that she could make her way without difficulty to Mme.
Lorraine's house.</p>

<p>A sudden terror and reluctance seized upon her at
thought of entering that house of danger, and unconsciously
her footsteps slackened their headlong speed.</p>

<p>"To go back into the lion's den&mdash;it is hard!" she
thought; then, bravely, "But my friend risked his life
for me. I can not do less for him."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p>Weary and footsore, she toiled on toward Esplanade
Street, that was still far away.</p>

<p>She was but little used to walking, for Mme. Lorraine
had never permitted her to leave the house, and her only
excursions had been her stolen rides on the back of Selim,
Mme. Lorraine's petted Arab. Her headlong pace at first
began to tell on her now, and her steps grew slower and
slower, while her slight figure and fair face attracted much
attention from passers-by on the brightly lighted street,
although her shy, frightened air protected her from insult
from even the evil disposed. Her purity, so sweetly
imaged on her young face, was a potent shield.</p>

<p>At length she emerged into Esplanade Street. She had
been several hours making her way from the convent to
this point.</p>

<p>It was nearing midnight, and the girl was vaguely
frightened, although, in her almost infantile innocence
and ignorance, she knew nothing of the "danger that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
walks forth with the night" in the streets of a great city.
She had been more fortunate than she knew in escaping
molestation and pursuit. Her chief fear had been of pursuit
by the fanatical old priest, but her hurried glances
behind her, from time to time, failed to discover any pursuer;
and in a short while more she stood trembling before
the dark, silent front of the house where her young life
had been spent in semi-slavery as the plaything of giddy
Mme. Lorraine.</p>

<p>A strange impulse seized her to turn and fly away; a
stronger instinct rooted her to the ground.</p>

<p>"He is here! he must be here!" she murmured; "and
I can not desert him, my good friend."</p>

<p>She stood there a few moments gazing at the closed
door, then walked rapidly to the garden gate by which she
had let Van Zandt through that memorable night. By a
strange chance of fortune she had the key in her pocket.</p>

<p>Unlocking it softly, she let herself into the garden, and
sunk down wearily on the rustic seat where she had fallen
into such heavy sleep the night of her attempted abduction.
Against her will her eyelids drooped, and slumber
stole over her weary senses. The soft air coolly fanned
her hot face, and the April dew fell heavily on her floating
hair and thin summer dress; but, unconscious of the chill
and dampness, she dreamed on until the first faint gray
streak of dawn appeared in the east.</p>

<p>Then she woke suddenly, lifted her crouching figure,
and looked about her. Memory rushed over her in a bewildering
flood.</p>

<p>"I have been asleep when I ought to have been planning
how to get into that house unperceived to search for
him!" she thought, self-reproachfully.</p>

<p>She knew that there would be no great difficulty about
the matter, because Mima was always very careless about
fastening up the back part of the house. Being slight and
agile, she made an easy entrance into the house by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
united opportunities of a step-ladder and an unbolted back
window.</p>

<p>With a throbbing heart and shining eyes, she found herself
inside the house, and, as she believed, near to the kind
Yankee friend in whom she took such an earnest interest.</p>

<p>Every one was asleep at this uncanny hour of the dawn,
she knew. Lightly and fearlessly she went from room to
room until she had explored the whole house in a fruitless
quest for Eliot Van Zandt.</p>

<p>To her dismay and disappointment, her careful search
was utterly unavailing, although from her knowledge of
the house she was certain that she had left not a room unvisited.
She had even peeped, by the aid of a hall-chair,
into the transom over madame's door, and then into
Mima's, too; but the sight of the latter placidly snoring
among her pillows, and of madame slumbering sweetly, as
if no unrepented sins lay heavy on her conscience, was all
that rewarded her for her pains.</p>

<p>Disappointed and dismayed, she crept into an unused
closet in the hall, and crouching in the cobwebby corner,
gave herself up to such intense cogitation that the tired
young brain succumbed again to weariness, and she
drooped forward upon the hard floor fast asleep.</p>

<p>Day was far advanced when she roused herself, with a
start, and again realized her situation. She heard steps
and voices, and knew that the small family was awake and
astir. Presently the hall clock chimed the hour of noon.</p>

<p>"I have been very lazy," she said to herself, "and&mdash;oh,
dear, I am very hungry!"</p>

<p>She remembered then that the nuns had not given her
any supper, because she had flatly refused to beg Father
Quentin's pardon for her wilfulness.</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said valiantly to herself, "I must
not remember that I am tired and hungry until I find my
friend."</p>

<p>But hot tears came into the dark eyes, all the same. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
was not pleasant to be tired and hungry and disappointed,
and even in hiding like a dreadful criminal fearing to be
captured.</p>

<p>Suddenly the swish of a silken robe trailed through the
hall met her ears&mdash;Mme. Lorraine!</p>

<p>The fugitive could not resist the temptation to push the
door ajar ever so little, and peep through the tiny aperture
at her fair enemy.</p>

<p>And then something very strange happened.</p>

<p>Little Nobody, or Marie, as the nuns had called her,
saw Mme. Lorraine stop abruptly at the end of the hall
and press her white and jeweled hand upon a curious little
ornate knob that appeared to form the center-piece of the
carvings and panelings of the wainscoted wall. Instantly
a section of the broad paneling glided backward through
the solid wall, like a narrow door. Mme. Lorraine stepped
lightly through the opening, and disappeared as the concealed
door sprung quickly back into its place.</p>

<p>Like one stunned, the girl fell back into her place of
hiding.</p>

<p>She had spent all her life in this strange house without
a suspicion of the hidden room and the secret door, and its
sudden discovery almost paralyzed her in the first moment.</p>

<p>But presently her reason returned to her, and she murmured
with instant conviction:</p>

<p>"He is down there."</p>

<p>Following a sudden reckless impulse, and thinking
nothing of consequences, she bounded from the closet and
pressed her little hand upon the knob in the wall. At
first it remained stationary, but when she pushed harder it
yielded so suddenly as almost to precipitate her down a
short flight of steps on which it opened. Recovering her
balance, she stepped softly downward, and the narrow door
slipped soundlessly into its place again, and as if impelled
by a ghostly hand. But the fact was, that by some clever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
arrangement of springs beneath the first step, the slight
pressure of her foot on the boards was sufficient to close it.</p>

<p>She found herself now on the narrow flight of steps, in
thick darkness; but the momentary light that had glimmered
through the open door had shown her a narrow
passage and another door at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>Thrilling with curiosity, and without fear, the girl
groped her way softly downward to the passage, starting
as the murmur of voices came to her from the other side
of the door.</p>

<p>"I was right. He is here!" she thought, and flung
herself down on the floor in the darkness and listened with
her ear against the door.</p>

<p>It was Mme. Lorraine's clear, bell-like voice that was
speaking. It ceased its impassioned utterances at last,
and a deep, rich, manly voice replied to her&mdash;a familiar
voice that made Marie's heart beat tumultuously and a
sweet, warm color glow in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"It is he," she whispered, forgetting hunger, weariness,
everything unpleasant in exquisite relief and joy.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Almost a week had elapsed since the last visit of Mme.
Lorraine to Eliot Van Zandt.</p>

<p>During that time he had been very ill from the fever
brought on by his agitation at her indiscreet announcement
of the death of the girl in whom he had been so
warmly interested.</p>

<p>All Mima's skill and care had been required to ward off
a fatal consequence to this relapse, and the woman had
sternly forbidden any more calls from her mistress during
this critical state. Mme. Lorraine was so frightened that
she was very obedient to the mandate; but now the embargo
had been removed, and she was free to visit the
fascinating patient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>He was better. Indeed, he was rapidly convalescing,
owing to Mima's good nursing, aided by his youth and a
strong constitution.</p>

<p>So, on this lovely April morning, madame had made
herself beautiful by every device of art at her command,
and hurried through the secret door to visit the wounded
captive whom she held in durance vile.</p>

<p>Pale and wan, but exceedingly handsome still, Eliot
Van Zandt lay upon a velvet lounge, his fair Saxon beauty
thrown into strong relief by the dressing-gown of dark-blue
silk that madame's care had supplied.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the superbly dressed and handsome
woman, his dark brows met with a heavy frown.</p>

<p>"I gave orders, Madame Lorraine, that you should not
be admitted again!" he exclaimed, with the frank petulance
of convalescence.</p>

<p>Madame gave her graceful head an airy toss.</p>

<p>"No one can debar me from the privilege of entering
any room in my own house," she replied, coolly.</p>

<p>"Your own house?" starting.</p>

<p>"Precisely," with a maddening smile; and for at least
two minutes a dead silence reigned in the room that, with
its swinging-lamp burning brightly, presented the appearance
of night, although it was midday outside.</p>

<p>Then he exclaimed, angrily:</p>

<p>"I had already become convinced that there was something
mysterious in my sojourn here. I have found out
that I am in an underground apartment from which there
is no apparent egress. I know that no living soul but
yourself and your servant has been near me since I was
ill. Am I, then, your prisoner?"</p>

<p>Smilingly, she replied:</p>

<p>"Do not call it by so harsh a word. It is true that you
are in my house, hidden in an underground apartment;
but it was for your own good that I brought you here.
You had fatally wounded Remond, and the authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
were after you. I&mdash;I love you," falteringly. "I could
not give you up to justice. So you are here&mdash;a prisoner,
if you will, but a beloved and well cared-for one."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have received skillful care and attention from
your servant. I thank you," very stiffly; "but now I am
well, I desire to go."</p>

<p>"I am suspected of harboring you. My house is watched
by officers of the law. Should you go out, you would be
instantly arrested. <i>Mon Dieu</i>! that must not be!"</p>

<p>She looked at him with tender, pleading eyes.</p>

<p>He answered, curtly:</p>

<p>"If I have hurt Remond, I am willing to answer to the
law for my crime committed in the defense of the weak
and the helpless. I have no wish to shirk my punishment.
You understand me now, and you will let me go. I demand
my release!"</p>

<p>Clasping her jeweled hands together in pretended despair,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But, good Heaven! <i>mon ami</i>, I can not let you be so
reckless. Think a moment what will happen if they take
you into custody. If the man dies, you may be&mdash;hung!"</p>

<p>"I take all the risk; only show me the way out of my
hated prison!" he exclaimed, impatiently; and, with sudden
passion, Mme. Lorraine answered, boldly:</p>

<p>"Then, by Heaven, I will not! There is but one way
by which you can ever leave this room, whose existence is
known to no human being but Mima, myself, and you."</p>

<p>She saw him grow deathly pale to the roots of his hair,
as he asked, with pretended coolness:</p>

<p>"And that way, my darling jailer?"</p>

<p>With something like a blush struggling through the cosmetics
that covered her face, she replied firmly, although
in a low voice:</p>

<p>"As my husband."</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence; the man was blushing
for her; the dark-red flush went up to the roots of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
hair; she saw it, and bit her lips. At last he said, with
cool disdain:</p>

<p>"You have already a husband in an insane asylum."</p>

<p>She interrupted, eagerly:</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;not my husband. I am free&mdash;that is, I was
divorced by law from him years ago."</p>

<p>She came nearer; she flung herself, with a rustle of silk
and heavy waft of patchouli, down by his side on the sofa.
Looking up into his face with burning eyes, she exclaimed,
wildly:</p>

<p>"Do not look so coldly and scornfully upon me! Since
you came to New Orleans, you have changed all my life.
I never loved before. I married Monsieur Lorraine for
wealth and position, without a single heart-throb for the
man. But you I love, you I have sworn to win. What is
there unreasonable about it, that your eyes flash so proudly?
You are handsome, it is true, but I also am beautiful.
You are gifted, but you are poor, while I am rolling
in wealth. I can take you from your drudging life and
make your existence a dream of luxury and ease. That is
generous, is it not? But you have bewitched me; you
have changed all my nature; you have taught me to love."</p>

<p>"I never tried to do so," he replied, with unmoved
coldness.</p>

<p>"Cold-hearted Yankee! have you no feeling, no pity?"
she demanded, reproachfully. "Look at me fairly,"
plucking impatiently at his sleeve. "Am I not fair
enough to teach you to love me?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, curtly, shrinking from her touch,
but looking straight into her impassioned eyes with cold,
unmoved gray orbs.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you already love some one else?" she burst
forth, jealously.</p>

<p>"No," in a cold, incisive voice.</p>

<p>A low laugh of triumph broke from her, and she exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I will not give you up. You shall be my husband."</p>

<p>He gave her an angry stare, but she continued, unheeding:</p>

<p>"To-night I leave New Orleans with my servant Mima.
I have my reasons for this step. <i>N'importe</i>; they concern
not you. I have made up my mind to be your wife, to
bear your name, to go home with you to Boston. If you
say the word, a priest shall be brought within the hour to
make us one. Then we can escape together to-night and
fly this fatal city which now holds imminent danger for
you. Do you consent?"</p>

<p>He looked with his cold, disconcerting gaze full into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"What if I refuse?" he queried.</p>

<p>"You are a Yankee all over&mdash;you answer one question
with another," she said, with a faint, mirthless laugh.
"But my alternative is so bitter I shrink from naming it.
Tell me, are you going to make me your loving wife?"</p>

<p>"I would die first!" he responded, with passionate emphasis.</p>

<p>She looked up at him, pale with wrath and mortification,
and hissed, angrily:</p>

<p>"You have chosen well, for it will come to that&mdash;to&mdash;to
death!"</p>

<p>"You would murder me?" he exclaimed, with a start;
and she answered, defiantly:</p>

<p>"If you can not be mine, no one else shall ever have
your love or your name. If you persist in refusing my
generous offer, I shall go away from here with Mima to-night;
but I shall leave you in this cellar to starve and
to die, and to molder into dust until the story of your
mysterious disappearance that night has been forgotten of
men."</p>

<p>"You could not be so inhuman!" he uttered, with paling
lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can, and I will," laughing mockingly. "Take
your choice now, monsieur&mdash;my time is limited. Shall it
be love&mdash;or&mdash;death?"</p>

<p>With ineffable scorn, although his handsome features
had waned to a marble pallor, he replied, in a voice of
proud disdain:</p>

<p>"Such love&mdash;the love of a guilty, wicked woman like
you, Madame Lorraine&mdash;leaves one no choice but death!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>


<p>He never forgot the glare of rage the angry woman fixed
upon him for a moment.</p>

<p>Her eyes fairly blazed as she hissed, vindictively:</p>

<p>"You have made your choice, and mine is the last human
face you will look upon. A few days of isolation in
this dreary chamber, without food or drink, and you will
go mad with horror and die of starvation. Adieu, monsieur.
I wish you <i>bon voyage</i> to Hades!"</p>

<p>She made him a mocking courtesy, and swept to the
door, tearing it open with such impetuous haste that the
listener outside had no time to step aside, only to spring
up wildly and confront the angry woman, who immediately
uttered a shriek of horror and fled up the narrow stair-way,
disappearing through the secret door in an incredibly
short space of time.</p>

<p>In the darkness of the narrow passage she had taken the
pale-faced, wild-eyed girl for a visitant from the other
world, and had fled in fear and terror from the supposed
ghostly presence.</p>

<p>In her terror she had forgotten to shut the door upon
Van Zandt, and with starting eyes he witnessed the strange
scene. For an instant he fancied, like Mme. Lorraine,
that it was a spirit standing there in the gloom of the narrow
passage, with face and form like that of the dead little
Mlle. Nobody. Then reason came to his aid. He sprung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
from the sofa, and just as the secret door shut behind the
frightened madame, he caught the girl's cold hand and
drew her into the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, my little ma'amselle! So that wicked woman lied
when she told me that you were dead!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She answered, vivaciously:</p>

<p>"No; for I have been dead and buried since I saw you,
Monsieur Van Zandt. Don't you see that Madame Lorraine
took me for a ghost? It was very fortunate for me,
was it not?" and soft, sweet trills of laughter bubbled over
her lips.</p>

<p>In her joy at finding him again, she forgot hunger, fear,
and weariness.</p>

<p>And in her excitement and exhilaration she rapidly
poured out all that had happened to her since that night,
nearly two weeks ago, when he and Carmontelle had so
ably prevented her abduction by Remond.</p>

<p>He listened in deepest interest; and if Mme. Lorraine
could have seen the joy that sparkled in his expressive
eyes, she would have felt like plunging a dagger into the
white breast of the girl who had brought that joy there by
her return, as it were, from the dead.</p>

<p>He laughed with her at the idea of Mme. Lorraine having
fooled herself so cleverly in imagining Little Nobody
a ghost.</p>

<p>"But you must not call me Little Nobody any longer.
I am Marie now," she said, brightly.</p>

<p>"It is a sweet, pretty name," he replied; "but I wish
I had been permitted to choose your name. It should
have been something else&mdash;something unique, like yourself."</p>

<p>She did not know what the word unique meant. She
looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"What would you have called me?" she queried.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will tell you some day," he replied, with an
odd little sigh; and then he changed the subject by telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
her how glad he was that she had been saved from death,
and how thankful that she had come to save him from the
tortures of death by starvation.</p>

<p>The dark eyes sparkled with eager joy.</p>

<p>"Ah, how pleasant it is to have a friend!" she said,
naïvely. "First you saved me, now I am going to save
you. I heard everything she said to you. Oh, how cruel
and wicked she is! And it must be dreadful," shuddering,
"to starve! I can fancy some of its horrors, for, do
you know, Monsieur Van Zandt, I am very hungry now?
I have had no supper nor breakfast."</p>

<p>"Poor child!" he exclaimed, and glanced at a covered
waiter on a stand that contained the remains of his late
breakfast. He drew off the dainty napkin, and she saw
delicate rolls, broiled chicken, cold ham, preserves, fresh
strawberries, chocolate and coffee, the whole flanked by a
bottle of sherry.</p>

<p>"I had no appetite for my breakfast, and Mima did not
come back to remove the tray," he said. "Dare I offer
you the remains of the repast? The chocolate is cold, but
I drank none of it; I preferred coffee. Likewise, the
broiled chicken is untouched&mdash;in fact, I eat nothing but a
roll."</p>

<p>"You shall see that I will do more justice to the fare
than that," she laughed; and sitting down by the tray, she
made a substantial meal, after which she declared herself
much strengthened.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant to have this bright, hopeful young
creature with him, in lieu of the loneliness and the cruel
fate to which Mme. Lorraine had doomed him. He listened
with interest to her pretty plans for his release. She
told him how, in her drugged sleep, she had beheld him
in this very room, attended by the big, ugly, but skillful
Mima.</p>

<p>"Heaven must have sent you that vision," he said, with
fervent gratitude. "Oh, how glad I am that I shall go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
free again into the world! I have sweet, young sisters
little older than you, my child, who would grieve for me
were I to die like this. Are you sure, quite sure, that you
possess the secret of the opening of the hidden door?"</p>

<p>Marie started.</p>

<p>"It must be the same as that of the outside&mdash;must it
not, monsieur?" she queried, with a confident air.</p>

<p>"I am not sure, but I hope it is," he replied, with a
sudden dawning anxiety.</p>

<p>"I will go and see at once," she exclaimed, starting
toward the door.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, and held her back.</p>

<p>"But why?" she asked, turning on him her pretty,
puzzled face.</p>

<p>With a smile, he answered:</p>

<p>"Do you not see that it would not be safe to venture to
open the door while our enemies remain in the house? We
must wait patiently here until night&mdash;until they are gone
away. Then we shall be able to effect our escape unmolested."</p>

<p>He spoke more cheerfully than he felt. A strange
dread was upon him. What if they should not be able to
open the door at the head of the cellar stair-way?</p>

<p>What if he were indeed hopelessly immured within this
prison, the life of the girl forfeited to the bravery and daring
that had led her to seek and save him?</p>

<p>"Oh, I could bear it like a man, alone, but for her to
perish under the slow agony of starvation&mdash;Heaven forbid
it!" he groaned, but breathed not a word of his fears to
the girl who was full of hope and eager expectancy, looking
eagerly forward to the hour of their release.</p>

<p>In spite of his anxiety, he spent a not unpleasant day in
the society of Marie. She was so lovely and so unique, in
her total ignorance of the world, that she had a subtle
charm for the man inured to the conventionalities of
society. Then, too, she was constantly exciting his wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
by the general correctness of her language, although
he knew that she was totally uneducated. But he easily
accounted for this by recalling the fact that she had been
brought up in constant contact with Mme. Lorraine and
her visitors, and so unconsciously acquired the habit of
correct speaking.</p>

<p>"What a contrast she is to that wicked woman!" he
thought, looking admiringly at the eager, earnest, mobile
face, so innocently frank, all the feelings of her pure soul
mirrored in her limpid eyes. Recalling madame's story
that the girl was low-born, he frowned, and said angrily
to himself:</p>

<p>"I do not believe it. She has nothing low about her.
There is some mystery about her origin, and Madame
Lorraine does not choose to reveal it, that is all."</p>

<p>Certainly, no girl born with the blood of a hundred earls
in her veins could have had better instincts or more innate
refinement than this Little Nobody. She was innocently
frank, but she was also charmingly shy and modest. She
was child and woman exquisitely blended:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Standing with reluctant feet<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where the brook and river meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Womanhood and childhood flee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Although she had been overjoyed at finding the reported
dead man alive, she had been very undemonstrative in her
joy. She had not offered him a single caress, such as one
so young might have done; she had not even seated herself
near him. She contented herself with looking at him
across the breadth of the room, not as one afraid, but with
a perfectly natural reserve, and she preserved this frank,
unembarrassed demeanor throughout the whole day, which
did not seem long to either, although dinner and supper
were among the things that were not. Neither one remembered
it, neither one was conscious of any sensation
of hunger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how are we to know when night comes? It is
always night down here," he said.</p>

<p>"It was about midday when I followed Madame Lorraine
down here. Have you a watch?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; and I have never permitted it to run down since
I came here. It is now twenty minutes to four o'clock,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Then it is now afternoon. By and by, when the
watch tells us it is nightfall, I will creep up the steps and
listen for sounds in the hall. When I hear them go away,
it will be the signal for us to open the secret door and
escape," she said.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock, with her ear pressed against the secret
paneled door, she heard mistress and maid going through
the hall to the front door. It opened and shut. Marie
heard distinctly the loud click of the key in the lock outside.
They had gone, leaving their victim to perish, as
they thought, by the slow pangs of starvation.</p>

<p>Van Zandt was close by her side; she turned to him
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I have been feeling the door in the dark for a knob
like that on the outside, but I can not find it," she said.
"The surface seems perfectly smooth, not carved as on
the outside. Will you bring the lamp, monsieur, and let
us search for it?"</p>

<p>With a sinking heart, he obeyed her request, detaching
the swinging-lamp from its bronze frame and taking it up
the dark stair-way in his hand. Even then, in his eager
anxiety, his artistic eye took note of the gleam of the light
on the girl's picturesque masses of red-gold hair, as it
waved in silken luxuriance over her shoulders.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p>Marie did not see Van Zandt's eyes looking admiringly
at her beautiful hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>She was gazing with eager eyes at the narrow door that
had shut her in with him whom she had dared so much to
find and save.</p>

<p>She saw with some dismay that its inner surface was just
what it had appeared when she had moved her fingers over
it in the dark&mdash;perfectly smooth, without seam, knob, or
lock, and no apparent way of moving it from its place.</p>

<p>Van Zandt gave her the lamp to hold, and put his
shoulder to the immovable door, but his whole strength
availed nothing against its grim solidity.</p>

<p>Then he spent an anxious hour trying the steps and the
sides of the door in an effort to find its mysterious open
sesame.</p>

<p>Not an iota of success rewarded his frantic efforts.</p>

<p>But he would not give way to despair.</p>

<p>"I shall have to cut our way out," he said. "But, as
I have no hatchet, it will be slow work with my jack-knife.
You may have to hold that lamp for hours,
ma'amselle, while I whittle a hole in the door big enough
for you to creep through."</p>

<p>"That is nothing. I shall not be tired," she replied,
bravely.</p>

<p>But she was not called upon for this exhibition of
patience.</p>

<p>The first few strokes of the knife revealed to him the
appalling fact that the inside of the door was not of wood,
but iron&mdash;iron so heavily coated with thick paint that it
had cleverly deceived the superficial touch.</p>

<p>Then indeed she caught a gleam of trouble in his eyes&mdash;trouble
that was almost despair. Her own face paled,
and a sigh of dismay escaped her lips.</p>

<p>When he heard it, he forced a smile.</p>

<p>"Do not be frightened; we will find some other way,"
he said.</p>

<p>And they went back to the room and searched the walls
carefully to see if there was any weak spot by which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
might effect an escape. Windows there were none, and
the ventilation of the room had been cleverly effected by
pipes that were let into the ceiling above. The walls
around were damp and cool, showing that they were built
into the earth; but they were thick and heavy, and Van
Zandt's jack-knife made no impression on the heavy oaken
planks beneath the handsome wall-papering.</p>

<p>Two hours were spent in this vain quest for means of
egress from their prison, and drops of dew beaded the
young man's face. He was weak from his illness and
from the fast that had lasted all day, and sat down at last
to rest and to think what he should do next.</p>

<p>"Oh, how tired and weak you must be! I am so sorry
I eat your breakfast! I shouldn't have done so, but I
thought we should get out of here directly!" exclaimed
the girl, regretfully.</p>

<p>She brought him the wine and poured out a glass, which
she forced him to taste. It ran warmly through his veins,
and courage returned to him again.</p>

<p>"Now, no more for me," he said, pressing back the
little hand that offered the second glass. "Drink that
yourself ma'amselle, and we must keep the rest for you,
for we can not tell how long it may be before we get out
of this."</p>

<p>"I do not need it; I am strong enough without it," she
replied, and replaced the untouched glass on the stand.
Then she saw him looking at her with a hopeful gleam in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I have a new thought," he said. "Perhaps if we
could make ourselves heard from down here, some one
might come to our relief. Let us halloo, ma'amselle, with
all our might."</p>

<p>It would have been ludicrous if it had not been so pitiful
to hear them shouting in concert at the top of their voices.
Indeed, they paused now and then to look at each other
with laughing eyes, and to pant with exhaustion from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
efforts, but the shouting was kept up at intervals until
Van Zandt's watch recorded the hour of midnight.</p>

<p>Then he said, wearily:</p>

<p>"There is no help for it. We shall have to pass the
night here, I suppose."</p>

<p>He opened the door and began to push his sofa out into
the narrow little passage.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" Marie asked him, with
large eyes of wonder.</p>

<p>"I am simply converting this passage into a temporary
bedroom for myself," he answered. "Good-night,
Ma'amselle Marie; I leave you my room and bed. Lie
down and rest, and in the morning we will try to devise
some new plan for our escape."</p>

<p>He opened and shut the door, and Marie was alone.
She threw herself wearily on the luxurious bed, and in
spite of hunger and thirst and terror, slept heavily for
hours.</p>

<p>When she awakened, she felt sure that day must be far
advanced. She found a large pitcher of water and poured
out some into a basin and bathed her face and hands.
Then she peeped out into the dark passage for Van Zandt.</p>

<p>He was sitting up composedly on his sofa, as if he had
been awake for hours.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, monsieur, I have kept you out in the dark
for hours! Come in," she exclaimed; and he accepted the
invitation with alacrity, pushing in his convenient sofa
before him.</p>

<p>Laughingly, he said:</p>

<p>"I began to think you were a second Rip Van Winkle,
Ma'amselle Marie;" and, holding out his watch to her, she
saw that it was near the middle of the day.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lazy I have been! Forgive me!" she cried,
vexed with herself. "You must have been very tired
waiting out there in the dark?"</p>

<p>"No, for I was at work trying to find the secret spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of the iron door, but I only wasted my time and strength,"
he replied, sadly.</p>

<p>"Oh, what are we going to do?" she burst out, in sudden
terror.</p>

<p>"That is what I was asking myself at intervals all
through the night," said Eliot Van Zandt. "Oh, my
child&mdash;my brave little girl! what would I not give if only
you had not followed Madame Lorraine into this fatal
prison! I could suffer alone with a man's fortitude, but
for you to share my fate is too dreadful!"</p>

<p>His voice broke and his eyes grew strangely dim. She
answered, with pretty gravity:</p>

<p>"It was through your goodness to me that you were
first betrayed into her power; and if you have to suffer for
it, I want to suffer, too. We are friends, you know. But
we must not give up hope yet. I am more sorry than ever
that I eat your breakfast; but take a little of the wine,
and it will strengthen you."</p>

<p>"After you," he replied, seeing that she would not be
satisfied without seeing him take some. He held the glass
to her lips, and she swallowed a few drops under protest.
He went through the same form, saying to himself that he
must save it all for her, for there was nothing else between
her and utter starvation.</p>

<p>"What shall we do next? Halloo again?" she asked,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"I do not believe my lungs are strong enough to go
over that ordeal again. The wound in my breast is not
quite healed over yet," he said. "But suppose we sing
instead?"</p>

<p>"I do not know how to sing," she answered.</p>

<p>"Very well; I shall have to do all the singing," he replied,
good-humoredly. "And, do you know, I think it
is a rather good idea to sing, for who knows but it may
penetrate to the street, and if it be known that Madame
Lorraine be gone away, curiosity may lead some one to investigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
into the cause of the mysterious noise, and then
we may be found."</p>

<p>"Oh, how clever you are! Do begin at once!" she exclaimed,
with a hopeful light in her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I will," he replied; and somehow the first song that
came to his mind was a sweet, sad love song he had been
used to sing with his fair young sisters in the far-off
Northern home he loved so well:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In days of old, when knights were bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And barons held their sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A warrior bold, with spurs of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Sung merrily his lay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'My love is young and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My love hath golden hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And eyes so bright and heart so true<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That none with her compare;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So what care I, tho' death be nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'll live for love or die!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So this brave knight, in armor bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Went gayly to the fray;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He fought the fight, but ere the night<br /></span>
<span class="i3">His soul had passed away.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The plighted ring he wore<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Was crushed and wet with gore;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Yet ere he died he bravely cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I've kept the vow I swore;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So what care I, tho' death be nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I've fought for love, and die&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For love I die!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The girl's beautiful eyes looked at the singer, dark and
grave with the strange emotions swelling at her heart.
She had heard Mme. Lorraine and the men from the
Jockey Club sing their best, but it had not affected her
like this. A strange, sweet awe stole over her, mixed with
a buoyancy and lightness that was thrilling and yet solemn.
With the strange, new sensation there came to her a sudden
memory of the chapel at Le Bon Berger, and the soft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
murmuring voices of the nuns at prayer. She felt like
praying.</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously, and she said, with child-like
directness:</p>

<p>"I can not sing, but the nuns at the convent taught me
how to pray. I will pray to the good God, and perhaps
He will hear me and save us."</p>

<p>The next minute she had thrown herself down by a
chair, bowed her golden head on her hands, and a low,
soft murmur of prayer filled the room. He hesitated a
moment, then went and knelt down by her side, and his
deeper, stronger voice filled the room with a strong, manly
petition for help and pity.</p>

<p>Then he did not feel like singing again for awhile, so
sweet and deep an awe pervaded his mind. Marie sat opposite,
her tiny hands folded in her lap, a lovely seriousness
on her piquant face.</p>

<p>By and by he sung again, but this time it was one of the
solemn chants, such as might be heard in the choirs of the
old cathedrals.</p>

<p>The day wore on like this, and the night fell again, with
no sign that the persistent singing had attracted any attention
from the outer world.</p>

<p>Sadly enough, and with many grim forebodings, Van
Zandt wheeled his sofa again into the narrow passage for his
night's rest. As he bid her good-night, Marie said, sadly:</p>

<p>"The oil is getting low in the lamp. I will extinguish
it to-night if you have a match to light it in the morning."</p>

<p>He was fortunate enough to find a little match-case in
his pocket filled with matches that he carried for lighting
his cigars; so Marie extinguished the lamp until morning,
and they turned on a very dim light that day, for they
feared that they should soon be left in total darkness.
To-day, also, the last of the wine was used, Marie insisting
that they should share alike, for both began to feel the
deathly weakness of hunger paralyzing their energies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
The singing at intervals was still persevered in, although
Van Zandt's voice began to fail strangely from the weakness
of hunger and illness. Hope failed him, too, as this,
the third day of their mutual imprisonment waned to a
close, and he regretted bitterly that he had allowed Marie
to force him to take a share of the precious sherry.</p>

<p>Faint and fainter waxed the light, and the two victims
of Mme. Lorraine's malignity began to realize that the
horrors of Cimmerian darkness were about to be added to
those of starvation and isolation.</p>

<p>"Sing something," said Marie, from the depths of the
arm-chair where she was resting.</p>

<p>He fancied that her voice sounded strange and faint,
and his heart sunk heavily. He wished again that the
poor child had never ventured into this horrible trap from
which there seemed to be no release but death. But he
had already wished it a hundred times before&mdash;alas, to no
avail!</p>

<p>"Sing," she murmured again, sadly. "See, the light
is almost gone, but it will not seem so dreary when you
sing."</p>

<p>He said to himself that he would be willing to sing until
the last breath left his lips, could he but lighten one pang
of the suffering girl whose devotion to him had brought
down such a cruel fate upon her head.</p>

<p>So, although his throat was sore, his head dizzy, and his
heart like lead in his breast, he sung feebly, but bravely,
a song that yesterday she had said she liked. It was
sweet; but sad. He had no heart for gay ones now:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Out in the country, close to the road-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">One little daisy there chanced to grow;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It was so happy there in the sunshine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">No one the daisy's joy could know;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Watching the white clouds, hearing a song there,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">List'ning in wonder all day long.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Oh,' said the daisy, 'had I a song-voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Yonder forever I'd send my song.'<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It was a lark that sung in the heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">While all the world stood still to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Many a maiden looked from her knitting,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And in her heart there crept a tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Down came the lark and sung to the daisy,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Sung to it only songs of love;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till in the twilight slumbered the daisy,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Turning its sweet face to heaven above.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah! for the morrow bringeth such sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Captured the lark, and life grew dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There, too, the daisy, torn from the way-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Prisoned and dying, wept for him.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Once more the lark sung; fainter his voice grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Her little song was hushed and o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Two little lives gone out of the sunshine,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Out of this bright world for evermore."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He paused and looked at her in the dim light. The
young face was very pale, the dark eyes hollow with purple
rings around them.</p>

<p>"I would give the world, were it mine, for food for this
dying child!" he thought, in bitter anguish.</p>

<p>With a languid smile and in childish innocence, she
said:</p>

<p>"I like your little song, Monsieur Van Zandt. Do you
know, I think it suits us two? You are the lark, and I
the little daisy. And&mdash;and&mdash;we need not hope any longer,
I am afraid. We will soon be gone out of life, like the
lark and the little daisy."</p>

<p>The last words were so faint as to be scarcely audible.
Her eyes had closed while she uttered them, and now the
golden head fell languidly against the back of her chair.</p>

<p>With a cry of alarm, Eliot Van Zandt sprung to her
side, and discovered, to his dismay, that she was quite unconscious.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p>"Unconscious, and not a drop of wine or water with
which to revive her&mdash;not even a breath of fresh air, though
the whole world is so full of it!" he murmured, in despair.</p>

<p>He flew to the water-pitcher in a wild hope, and found
there a few spoonfuls which he had begged her to drink in
the morning. She had pretended to do so, but here it was
untouched. So terrible was his own thirst that his heart
leaped at sight of it, but not for worlds would he have appropriated
even one small drop from his companion in
misery.</p>

<p>Hastily pouring it into a glass, he pressed it against her
lips, moistening them gently until they parted, and a few
drops of the precious fluid passed between them and down
her parched throat. A sigh heaved her breast, and her
eyes unclosed.</p>

<p>Eliot Van Zandt cried out in joy and relief, and laying
her head back against his arm, he gently forced her to
swallow the remainder of the water. It acted like a
charm, for withdrawing her head from his arm, she sat
upright, and said, in a weak voice:</p>

<p>"I kept the water for you; I did not want to drink it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, child; I am strong, and did not need it,"
lightly. "But do you feel better now?"</p>

<p>"Much better; but I think I will lie down, monsieur, I
feel so tired. Is it bed-time yet?" trying to smile.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch by the light that was so feeble
now that he could scarcely see the hands moving across its
face.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is bed-time. It is past ten o'clock," he said;
then, with hesitation: "Are you not too sick for me to
leave you, child? I can sit here and watch you while you
sleep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Within himself he thought sadly that the conventionalities
of the world were out of place now, when both were
hovering on the border of the Unknown Land. Why not
sit beside the dying girl and soothe her last sad hours?</p>

<p>But with a pensive smile she answered:</p>

<p>"No; go to your rest, dear friend. I shall do very well
alone, but if I feel ill again I will call you."</p>

<p>Thus dismissed, he wheeled his sofa, as usual, into the
dark and gloomy little passage outside the door. Then,
lingering to press the little hand and say good-night more
tenderly than ever in the presentiment that weighed upon
him, she startled him by a shrill, frightened cry:</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>The light had given one expiring flare and gone out,
leaving them in darkness.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid? Shall I leave my door ajar?" he
asked, gently.</p>

<p>"No, no," she answered, quickly.</p>

<p>"Very well, then; but I shall not go to sleep. I shall
lie awake to guard you from any fancied danger," he said;
and sighed, knowing that there was nothing to fear save
the grim, gaunt hunger-wolf.</p>

<p>He struck a match that he might smile once more, sadly
but tenderly, into the pale, patient face. She smiled
bravely in return.</p>

<p>"My good friend, good-night," she said gently; and
with a sigh he left her to hold a patient, wakeful vigil outside
her door.</p>

<p>Hours passed without a sound from the dark, inner
chamber, where Marie lay huddled among the pillows in
feverish sleep. At last, dizziness and weariness fairly conquered
him; his head drooped to the arm of the sofa, and
he, too, slept.</p>

<p>It seemed scarce a minute since his heavy eyes had shut
before he started up with a confused cry. Had some one
called his name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Some sort of a sound certainly echoed in his ears; it resolved
itself into <i>her</i> voice.</p>

<p>Marie's voice calling out loud and strange and incessant,
with incoherent words. He tore open the door wildly and
struck one of his precious matches.</p>

<p>She lay there among the pillows, with vacant, wide-open
eyes fixed on the ceiling, babbling in wild delirium of cool
springs and fountains, of summer showers, of falling dew,
her parched lips panting with fever.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God! if the world were mine, I would give it
for one draught of water for my suffering little darling!"
he cried aloud, with the agony of a man's heart driven to
bay.</p>

<p>The dim flame of the match died into darkness again,
and he stood by the bed, holding her hot little hand in his,
listening in agony to her delirious ravings.</p>

<p>"This is the cruelest hour of my life!" he muttered.
"Death, when it comes, will not be half so bitter."</p>

<p>By the aid of another match he looked at his watch. It
was five o'clock, and outside he knew that the day was
near its dawn; but within the chamber where he watched
by the side of the dying girl all was thick darkness and
gloom, and his stock of matches was running so low that
he dared not light one as often as he wished.</p>

<p>Agonized thoughts kept him grim company while he
stood listening to her ravings for water to cool her poor
parched tongue and lips.</p>

<p>Soon she would be dead, and her harrowing sufferings
all over. Then he would be alone with the dead girl until
death mercifully came to his release. Here they would lie,
uncoffined and unburied for years, moldering into dust,
their cruel fate forever hidden from men. In his far-off
home his sisters would grieve for him awhile, then he
would be forgotten.</p>

<p>The tiny flame of another match flared into the air at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
six o'clock. Her ravings had ceased, the hot flush had
left her face, the little palms were cool again. She lay
with wide-open eyes upon the pillow, breathing faintly&mdash;so
faintly that he looked for every breath to be her last.</p>

<p>In the anguish of that thought, a wild temptation came
to him. Somewhere he had read that debilitated invalids
were strengthened and restored to health by drinking the
fresh, warm blood of newly slaughtered beeves.</p>

<p>He tore open the blade of his knife and desperately
punctured a vein in his arm. The hot, red blood spurted
like a fountain, and he caught it in the wine-glass until it
was full.</p>

<p>A handkerchief bound tightly about his arm stopped the
bleeding of the wound, and, with some difficulty in the
darkness, and shuddering with weakness and emotion, he
lifted Marie's head on his arm and pressed the glass to her
lips.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p>He scarcely dared hope that she would have enough
strength to swallow his strange medicine, but, to his joy,
the dry lips parted and clung to the glass until every drop
of the liquid had been drained, then, with a long sigh of
relief, her head fell back, and he laid it gently on the
pillow.</p>

<p>"Have I revived her, or&mdash;killed her?" he muttered,
in a fright.</p>

<p>Another match. If it had been the last one, he must
have one glimpse of her face now.</p>

<p>It lay pale, with shut eyes, and apparently lifeless, on
the white pillow. He felt her pulse hurriedly. A feeble,
thread-like pulsation assured him that life still lingered.
He sat down sorrowfully in a chair by the bed, holding the
pulse beneath his finger, waiting sadly for the last.</p>

<p>Seven o'clock by the light of the last match, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
pulse still throbbed softly, and, he almost dared to hope,
more strongly.</p>

<p>"What does it mean? Has my experiment indeed given
her a few more hours of life?" he wondered, gladly.</p>

<p>It seemed so, for the thread-like pulse gradually grew
stronger, and bending down his head, he caught a faint
but regular breathing.</p>

<p>"Marie," he said, softly, and a quickened breath that
was almost a gasp assured him that she heard. "I am
here by your side," he went on. "It is dark, and I have
used all the matches, so I can not watch your face to see
if you are better. Can you speak to me, dear?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she uttered, faintly, and his heart leaped
with joy at the sound.</p>

<p>"You are better," he exclaimed, and she murmured a
faint:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Then she seemed to fall asleep. He fought bravely
against the deathly weakness that was stealing over him.
A passionate prayer was in his heart:</p>

<p>"Lord, send us help before it is too late!"</p>

<p>Hours seemed to pass while he sat there in a strange
half-stupor that most likely would merge into delirium, as
hers had done. Oh, the gnawings of hunger, the pangs of
thirst, how terrible they were!</p>

<p>"Yet, thank Heaven, I have lightened hers for a little
while by the life-fluid I freely gave!" he muttered.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the darkness, a little groping hand fell on
his face.</p>

<p>"Are you there still?" asked Marie's voice, weak but
clear.</p>

<p>"I am here still," he answered, taking the hand again
in his own. The pulse was much better now. She continued,
softly: "I feel stronger, but I was surely dying
when you gave me the sweet, warm milk to drink. It put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
new life in my veins, but&mdash;" she paused as if a new
thought had struck her mind.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, gently, and she answered:</p>

<p>"I can not imagine where you found the milk. I hope
you had some, too. It is so reviving. Did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, plenty," he replied, with a shudder, and she
said:</p>

<p>"I am so glad. But how dreary it is all in the dark!
Sing again, please."</p>

<p>It had seemed to him a minute ago that he was almost
too weak to speak, but he made a great effort to please
her, although he knew that it would exhaust his strength
all the sooner. He sung with all the power that remained
in his weak lungs. In the darkness and the gloom, the
dear old hymn, learned at his mother's knee in childhood,
sounded sweetly solemn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When other helpers fail and comforts flee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was a sudden, swift break in the voice that soared
upward to the pitying heavens&mdash;his strength had not given
out, but something wonderful had happened.</p>

<p>From over their heads, and seeming to come through
the small pipe provided to ventilate their darksome prison,
had come the distinct sound of a human voice.</p>

<p>"Halloo!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p>In almost the last hour, when hope had deserted them,
and they hourly expected death, succor had arrived. Van
Zandt's singing had attracted attention at last, and now
help was at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>When that ringing halloo came down the ventilating
pipe, he almost swooned with the suddenness of his joy
and relief; and it was Marie, who, with a sudden accession
of frantic joy, screamed shrilly back:</p>

<p>"Halloo!"</p>

<p>A voice came quickly back&mdash;a familiar voice:</p>

<p>"Who is down there?"</p>

<p>This time Van Zandt answered:</p>

<p>"Two prisoners&mdash;Eliot Van Zandt and a lady. We are
starving, dying! For God's sake, cut a hole quickly
through the floor, and come to our aid!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" said a hearty voice that belonged to none
other than Pierre Carmontelle; and then the iron will that
had sustained Van Zandt through those four dreadful days
gave way, and he fell in a heavy swoon to the floor.</p>

<p>Marie could only moan helplessly:</p>

<p>"Hurry, hurry! he has fallen down. I fear he is
dead!"</p>

<p>With all the haste that several eager men could make,
it was almost half an hour before a square opening appeared
in the ceiling large enough to admit a man's body.
Then a faint light streamed into the dark underground
chamber, fairly dazzling Marie's weak eyes.</p>

<p>Several eager pairs of eyes looked down, but they could
detect nothing yet, so intense was the gloom below.</p>

<p>"It is dark as Erebus," said a voice&mdash;Markham's,
Marie thought. "Van Zandt, where are you?"</p>

<p>Marie answered, with a sob:</p>

<p>"He is down on the floor, but he is very still, and I
fear he is dead from starvation."</p>

<p>A lantern at the end of a rope came quickly down the
aperture. A man's body followed it quickly&mdash;Carmontelle!</p>

<p>He came up to the bedside and looked with amazement
into the wan, sweet face of the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, it is Little Nobody! But what does it
mean? I thought you dead. I saw you entombed!"</p>

<p>But he had to wait for his answer, for Marie very provokingly
fainted dead away, and he had to halloo to Markham
above for water and wine.</p>

<p>"I think fresh air would do better than either just
now," was the reply. "<i>Peste</i>! what a hot, musty smell
comes up that hole! Take her in your arms, Carmontelle,
stand on a chair, and hand her up to me."</p>

<p>As the ceiling was low, this plan was effected without
much difficulty; and Markham took the slight figure in
his arms and carried her out to the cool, green garden,
where the last beams of sunset were glinting on the shining
leaves of the orange-trees and the tinkling waters of
the fountains. The cool air and the refreshing water soon
brought her back to life and hope again.</p>

<p>But Van Zandt was longer in recovering. He had kept
up the longer, but his collapse, when it came, had been
more complete. They found that the wound on his breast
was still unhealed, and that there was a mysterious fresh
wound upon his arm. The bandage had been knocked off
in his fall, and the blood was pouring out in a crimson
tide.</p>

<p>They stanched the wound, and at last brought him
around so that, with the aid of three men, he could be
hoisted through the hole in the wall. He was too weak
to answer questions at first, and it was not until the next
day that they learned the particulars of his imprisonment
by Mme. Lorraine.</p>

<p>They were inclined to chaff him considerably over the
madame's fatal <i>penchant</i> for his handsome face, and he
bore it with all the equanimity he could. Indeed, their
mirth seemed pleasant, although directed against himself,
after those four solemn days in that dark, underground
prison.</p>

<p>But interesting as they found his romantic story, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
tame beside that of Little Nobody, who, having had a good
night's sleep, nourishing food, and a good woman to watch
and soothe her restless slumbers, was so much refreshed
by the next morning that she could tell her strange story
with far more vivacity than could Van Zandt, whose
lungs, from his constant singing and hallooing without
food for four days, had terribly taxed his strength and endurance.</p>

<p>"If you had come even one hour later, I fear it would
have been too late for me," he said, with a somber look in
his gray eyes.</p>

<p>But it was owing to his persistent singing that he had
been rescued at last, for, although Carmontelle had never
given up the search for him, he had not dreamed that the
wounded man was concealed in madame's house, although
it was believed that she was cognizant of his fate.</p>

<p>"And this is how we chanced to find you," he said.
"It was determined to arrest Madame Lorraine upon suspicion
of complicity with Remond in making away with
you. Markham and I volunteered to come with the
officers to serve the warrant. As repeated ringings elicited
no response, we thought something was wrong, and forced
an entrance."</p>

<p>"And then?" Van Zandt queried, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, then we found not a living soul in the house, and
were in a little, stuffy back room, like a servants' bedroom,
debating what to do next, when the sound of your
unearthly singing made the hair rise upon our heads in
terror. We thought at first that it was something supernatural,
it sounded so sweet and strange, coming, as it
seemed, from the bowels of the earth, but presently Markham
said that Van Zandt was a fine singer, and a wild
suspicion came to me. I looked about and found a pipe
fixed cleverly into the wall to secure ventilation, as it
seemed to me, to some cellar-like apartment. I put my
mouth to the hole and hallooed down it as loud as I could."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"And thereby saved two lives that were almost ended.
How can I ever thank you and bless you enough, Carmontelle!"
Van Zandt exclaimed, with emotion.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>


<p>Mme. Lorraine would have been chagrined indeed
could she but have known what was transpiring in the
house she had quitted so precipitately upon finding out
that she was in danger of arrest upon suspicion of knowing
the whereabouts of Eliot Van Zandt.</p>

<p>The despised Little Nobody was installed in madame's
own luxurious chamber, with a capable elderly woman in
attendance. Eliot Van Zandt occupied another room,
equally elegant, and Carmontelle and Markham had also
installed themselves temporarily in a guest-chamber. In
the kitchen a temporary cook held sway until such time
as the young journalist could be moved to his hotel. Just
now he was prostrated on a bed of sickness, having suffered
a relapse from the reopening of his wound through his exertions
in hallooing and singing.</p>

<p>The cause of the slight wound upon his arm, which they
had found freshly bleeding, he steadily declined to explain.</p>

<p>"It is a mere nothing&mdash;the scratch of a pen," he said,
carelessly, and indeed it very soon healed. The wound on
his breast was doing nicely, too, and he began to talk of
leaving for home very soon&mdash;as soon as he was able to
travel.</p>

<p>Carmontelle had written to his anxious sisters to calm
their uneasy minds, and one day&mdash;it was a week after that
tragic evening when he had rescued the prisoners&mdash;he held
a very serious conversation with his friend over the subject
of Little Nobody's future.</p>

<p>Van Zandt had sat up in an easy-chair that day for the
first time, and Marie had come in to see him. She looked
bright and well again, and the young man shuddered as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
thought how near she had been to death that night in the
underground prison.</p>

<p>"But for my timely thought, my terrible experiment,
she must have been dead ere rescue came," he said to
himself. "But she must never know. Perhaps she
would shrink from me in horror did she but know the
truth."</p>

<p>Carmontelle had been very quiet while she remained in
the room. He had watched both narrowly. When she
had gone, he said, gravely:</p>

<p>"Van Zandt, let us speak together as good men and
true. Have you taken any thought for the little ma'amselle's
future?"</p>

<p>Van Zandt started and grew a shade paler. He scarcely
understood this abruptness, this seriousness.</p>

<p>"Her future?" he echoed, a little blankly. "I thought&mdash;I
understood&mdash;that it was all planned out that night
when we saved her. You were to educate her&mdash;afterward
to make her your wife."</p>

<p>Carmontelle frowned, and said, sternly:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but of course you understand that the plan is
untenable now?"</p>

<p>He looked straight into Van Zandt's beautiful blue-gray
eyes with such a meaning expression that in a moment
there rushed over the young man's mind a comprehension
of the truth. Flushing darkly, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Say no more. I understand you now," hoarsely;
"you mean that&mdash;that noble child is&mdash;is compromised by
her imprisonment with me those four long days?"</p>

<p>Carmontelle, with a fierce throb of jealousy at his heart,
answered:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Then, after a moment's blank silence on both sides, he
added, sighing heavily:</p>

<p>"Such is the cruel way of the world. For myself, Van
Zandt, I know you are the soul of honor, chivalrous as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
men of the South; and I can pay you no higher compliment
than this. For her, I know she is pure as an angel.
But&mdash;there is the cruel, carping world ready to point the
finger of scorn always, and I&mdash;warmly as I love the girl&mdash;I
could not have a bride of whom gossip could whisper
even one blighting suspicion. The Carmontelles are very
proud of their unblemished honor. I must not be the first
to smirch it. I could have passed over her birth, her
namelessness, for I could have given her my own proud
name, and lifted her to my own station; but&mdash;this shadow
from her misfortune in having shared your imprisonment
is too dark for me to bear. My hopes are in ashes. Instead
of being her husband, I must now claim the place of
a father or a brother."</p>

<p>It was a long speech for Carmontelle, who did not ordinarily
deal in long sentences. When it was finished he
wiped the great drops of moisture from his brow and waited
for Van Zandt to speak.</p>

<p>He did not have to wait long.</p>

<p>"I understand you," the young man said, with apparent
quietude. "The generous child, by her nobility in coming
to seek and to save me, sacrificed her own future. I
must&mdash;marry her&mdash;to appease the proprieties."</p>

<p>With a quiver of pain and regret in his voice, Carmontelle
said, gravely:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I am ready to make her that poor reparation for all
that she sacrificed for me," Van Zandt answered, instantly,
and for a moment their hands met in a firm, close grip.
Then the Southerner said sadly:</p>

<p>"My God, there is no other way, or I could not give up
the sweet hopes that for a few hours delighted my soul.
But we have talked it over at the club&mdash;my friends and
hers&mdash;and have all agreed that since the whole affair was so
widely known, there could be no other way out of it in
honor for that poor child than by marriage with you. Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Zandt, you look strange! Do you take it so hard, then?
Great Heaven! can it be that you have some prior engagement?"</p>

<p>"I am free&mdash;except from the claims of two young
sisters, and the trammels of poverty," Van Zandt answered,
quietly.</p>

<p>"Poverty, yes, I had thought of that; but she shall not
be a burden to you. I am rich, very rich. I will pay the
poor child's dowry. I will make it forty thousand dollars,
and when I die she shall be my heiress."</p>

<p>"Stop!" Eliot Van Zandt said, with the first sternness
he had shown. "You mistake me, Carmontelle; I will
take no dowry with my young bride, save her own innocence
and beauty."</p>

<p>"But I claim the right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I refuse to admit it."</p>

<p>And they looked stubbornly into each other's eyes.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p>Then Van Zandt said, sternly:</p>

<p>"I will have no one say that I was paid to take the girl
of my choice. I am not rich, as you know, but I will toil
harder now that I have such an object in life. She shall
not go shabby or hungry, I promise you."</p>

<p>His voice was so full of feeling, despite its sternness,
that Carmontelle was puzzled. He exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Your pride does you honor, Van Zandt. But&mdash;you
said&mdash;the girl of your choice. I do not understand!"</p>

<p>Van Zandt hesitated, then said reluctantly:</p>

<p>"Believe me, I do not want to make you feel your loss
more keenly by what I must now admit; but, Carmontelle,
the reparation I must make to Ma'amselle Marie is
not such that I need money to condone the sacrifice. I&mdash;I
love her, although I have never dared own the truth to
my own heart until this hour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the breast of the elder man there went a pang
of jealous pain, as he repeated, hoarsely:</p>

<p>"You love her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, since the first night I met her. But I scarcely
dared own the truth to my own heart. What had I, the
poor journalist, to do with that fair creature, whose beauty
in itself was a rich dower? But now, when fate itself has
given her to me, I can only rejoice."</p>

<p>"Rejoice, yes, that is best&mdash;much best," Carmontelle
said, after a long, constrained pause. "It is best," he
repeated again, more firmly.</p>

<p>"It was fate itself that gave her to me," Van Zandt
said, solemnly; and in a burst of emotion he made clear
the mystery of the wounded arm that had so puzzled his
friend.</p>

<p>"She was dying, and I gave my own blood to save her
life. It is my own life that leaps through her veins, that
sends the light to her eyes, the color to her cheek. But it
is my secret. She must never know."</p>

<p>"No, never; but by that noble sacrifice her life belongs
to you, and I can be unselfish enough, Van Zandt, in my
own disappointment, to wish that you may win her whole
young heart!" Carmontelle exclaimed, lifted out of all
selfish regrets by this strange revelation.</p>

<p>And then they planned it all out before Van Zandt lay
down to rest, taking Marie's consent for granted&mdash;Marie,
the simple, ignorant girl who could not have told you to
save her life what those two words, love and marriage,
meant.</p>

<p>She was as innocent as a babe over many things, poor
Little Nobody!</p>

<p>And, to do Van Zandt justice, he revolted at the thought
of taking her, as it seemed, willy-nilly; but the world, the
great wicked world, left him, as Carmontelle said, no
other way.</p>

<p>"I should have liked to woo and win my bride in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
sweet old fashion," he thought, regretfully; then, with a
new idea: "And what is there to hinder? The words of
the marriage service will be almost meaningless terms to
her untutored mind. I will take no advantage of the
claims it will give me. I will hold her as sacred as an
angel until I shall win her heart as well as her hand. At
home I will place her in the school-room with my sisters.
She shall have culture equal to her beauty, and I will work
for her and worship her in silence until the child becomes
a woman and her heart awakes from sleep."</p>

<p>The very next day he said to her gently:</p>

<p>"Ma'amselle Marie, I shall be going home to Boston in
two more days."</p>

<p>She cried out regretfully:</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sorry; I am afraid I shall never see you any
more!"</p>

<p>"Will you go with me, dear, and be my little wife?"</p>

<p>"I will go with you, yes; but&mdash;your wife&mdash;I do not
understand," she said, in a puzzled tone, just as he had
expected she would.</p>

<p>"You would live with me always," he began. "You
would belong to me, you would bear my name, you would
do as I wished you, perhaps, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, your slave?" she interrupted, intelligently.</p>

<p>Serious as he felt, he could not forbear a laugh; but he
said, gently:</p>

<p>"Not my slave, but my love, my darling, my treasure.
I would never beat you, nor scold you, nor make your life
sad, as Madame Lorraine did. I would be very kind to
you always. Now, will you be my wife?"</p>

<p>She replied, with childish frankness:</p>

<p>"Yes, I will be your wife and go with you to your
home. Then, perhaps, I will understand better your
word, 'wife.'"</p>

<p>He smiled and stooped to kiss her, but she drew back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
quickly, her innate shyness taking alarm. He did not
press her, only said to himself:</p>

<p>"My shy little wild bird, her heart is yet to win."</p>

<p>It seemed to him the strangest thing he had ever heard
of, this taking for a wife a young, untutored creature who
actually did not understand what the words love, marriage,
and wife meant.</p>

<p>He told Carmontelle later of his thought. The Southerner
was amused at the ignorance of the lovely girl&mdash;amused
and sorry in one breath, and with a sigh of regret,
he said:</p>

<p>"Happy is he who shall have the pleasure of teaching
her the meaning of those tender words."</p>

<p>It was arranged that the marriage should take place just
prior to Van Zandt's departure from New Orleans. Van
Zandt himself undertook to make Marie understand the
necessity for the marriage service that would make her his
wife. She acquiesced readily, and asked that Father
Quentin, the old priest at Le Bon Berger, be permitted to
perform the ceremony.</p>

<p>Her romantic fancy immediately invested the affair with
a halo of romance.</p>

<p>"I shall be a bride," she said, naïvely. "In madame's
fashion books there are brides all in white, with veils on
their heads. I shall be dressed like that, and the marriage
shall be out in madame's garden by moonlight. All the
Jockey Club shall come to see, and the nuns from the convent,
too, if they choose."</p>

<p>Van Zandt said it should be just as she liked. He employed
Marie's good nurse to buy the simple white India
muslin dress and tulle veil. Also a pretty gray serge
dress and straw hat for traveling.</p>

<p>Carmontelle presented her with a full set of large, lustrous
pearls to be worn at the ceremony, and the rest of
the Jockey Club, who had, since the day of Marie's splendid
riding, felt almost a proud proprietorship in her, contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
a great box full of costly wedding-gifts&mdash;jewels,
costly dressing-cases, perfume sets, glove-boxes full of tiny
kid gloves&mdash;everything, in short, that they could think of
on the spur of the moment, even adding a big photograph-album
in ivory and silver containing fac-similes of their
familiar faces.</p>

<p>Father Quentin, only too glad to be forgiven for his
treachery to Carmontelle, came to perform the ceremony
and bless the wedded pair. But before this auspicious
event a difficulty had arisen.</p>

<p>A marriage license must be procured; but what name
should be written in it for the nameless girl, Mme. Lorraine's
Little Nobody?</p>

<p>Pierre Carmontelle came quickly to the rescue.</p>

<p>"I adopt Marie as my daughter. I am quite old enough
to be her father. Let the name be written Marie Carmontelle,"
he said.</p>

<p>And so as Marie Carmontelle she was given into the
keeping of her handsome young husband.</p>

<p>Everything was arranged as she wished. The priest
grumbled at the oddity of the whole thing, but she was
married, all the same, out in the beautiful garden, by
moonlight, with the sweet scent of flowers all about her,
and her young face pale with excitement and strange emotion.
The Jockey Club came in a body to witness the
wedding, and some brought sisters and friends, who were
all agog over the romance of the affair, and said that the
bride was as lovely as a dream, and that that wicked Mme.
Lorraine ought to have been ashamed of herself for her
cruel treatment of one so beautiful and innocent. The
girl who but a little while ago had been friendless and
nameless had suddenly come into a heritage of hosts of
friends and one of the proudest names of New England.</p>

<p>There was no wedding banquet. When the bride had
been congratulated by everybody, and even kissed by some
of the beautiful, warm-hearted ladies who had come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
witness her strange marriage, her female attendant whisked
her off upstairs to change her white dress for a traveling
one; then, in a few more minutes, and with the sound of
kind adieus in her ears, she was in a carriage riding away
from all that her old life had ever known, except Eliot
Van Zandt, who sat by her side, her shy little hand in his,
and called her his wife.</p>

<p>Soon they were on board the steamer that rocked at the
wharf, soon they were sailing away on the breast of the
broad Mississippi, leaving behind the glimmering lights
and busy life of the quaint Crescent City, homeward
bound, and Eliot Van Zandt, who little more than two
months since had entered the harbor of New Orleans,
careless, gay, and fancy-free, was taking home a bride to
his ancestral home. He had asked himself rather nervously
several times what his brother and sisters would say.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>He thought more and more on this subject, for Marie,
her first timidity got over, began to ask him artless questions
about his home.</p>

<p>He told her that his family consisted of five members.
He had a brother older than himself, who was a lawyer in
Boston. He was married, but had no children, and he
lived in the old family mansion on Beacon Hill, with his
two sisters, Maud and Edith, who were respectively nineteen
and seventeen, and had not quit the school-room yet.
The fifth person was Mrs. Wilson, their governess.</p>

<p>"Maud is the elder. She is quite talented, and is writing
a novel," he said. "Edith is an embryo artist. My
brother's wife is very pretty and fashionable. I hope you
will like them all."</p>

<p>But a shudder crept over him at the thought of taking
home a bride into that refined and cultured circle to place
her in the school-room, to begin at the bottom of the ladder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of learning. How shocked they would be, how his
brother's wife would lift her pale brows in wonder! He
dreaded her more than all the rest, for two reasons. One
was that she had brought a little money into the once rich,
but now impoverished Van Zandt family, and took airs on
that account, and the other was that she had a pretty sister
with a <i>dot</i>, and wanted to make a match between her and
her brother-in-law. So Eliot fancied, and with some
reason, that she would not take kindly to the new-comer.</p>

<p>The further he got away from New Orleans, the more
he was tormented by his dread of his home-folks.</p>

<p>At last he made up his mind to give Marie some sight-seeing
in New York, and to write to his brother, and, to
some extent, prepare them for the shock they were to receive.</p>

<p>When the letter was written and posted, he felt better.
He had explained matters and invoked their good-will for
his simple child-wife. However much they were disappointed,
they would respect his wishes, they would not be
unkind to Marie.</p>

<p>So he gave himself up with a light heart to the pleasure
of showing her the wonders of New York City.</p>

<p>Several days were spent there, and then he took her to
Niagara Falls for a few days more. He judged by that
time that they would have got over the shock in Boston,
and be ready, perhaps, to receive Marie with equanimity.</p>

<p>In this hope, he took the train for Boston with his little
bride.</p>

<p>Throughout their long journey Van Zandt had adhered
to his manly resolve of treating his little bride simply as a
dear friend or young sister until she should have awakened
from a child into a woman and given her heart unreservedly
with a wifely love.</p>

<p>On the steamer she had her separate state-room, at
hotels her solitary suite of rooms, on the trains her comfortable
Pullman sleeping-car, while the chivalrous young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
husband lounged away the long hours in a smoking-car
with his favorite cigar. The young bride, in her ignorance
and innocence, had not an idea but that this was the usual
mode of procedure with husband and wife, and thoroughly
enjoyed the long journey and the varied scenery through
which she was being whirled. Its newness and the strong
contrast to her Southern home made it all the more delightful.
Eliot Van Zandt enjoyed her delight, her naïve
questions, and even her utter ignorance of everything,
although he sometimes caught himself wondering at the
fact. But the truth was, that the girl's invariably well-chosen
sentences, acquired from companionship with refined
and well-bred people, made him often forget that she
was totally uneducated, and that years of school-room
drudgery yet lay before her ere she could take her place in
the cultured world of Boston society.</p>

<p>"There is one comfort. She is exceedingly intelligent,
quick, and receptive. She will learn very fast," he told
himself.</p>

<p>One evening, at Niagara, when they sat together admiring
the glorious falls by moonlight, she said to him, curiously:</p>

<p>"You said once that if you could have chosen my name,
it would not have been Marie. Tell me what you would
have called me?"</p>

<p>Turning to her with a smile, he replied:</p>

<p>"The name that I always fancied I should like for my
wife to bear was the sweet one of Una&mdash;no sweeter, I
know, than Marie, but I grew to love the name from reading
Spenser's 'Faëry Queen.'"</p>

<p>Then he told her the pretty story, as well as he could,
of the beautiful Una who personified Truth in the "Faëry
Queen." She listened with sparkling eyes and eager interest.</p>

<p>"From this hour I shall be called Una," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But you have been baptized Marie," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"It shall be Una Marie, then," she replied, in her
pretty, positive fashion, and he was pleased to assent.</p>

<p>"From this hour, then, I shall call you Una, and you
shall call me Eliot."</p>

<p>"But, monsieur&mdash;" deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"No more monsieurs," he replied, playfully. "They
remind me too much of Madame Lorraine."</p>

<p>"It shall be Eliot, then, always," answered the little
bride.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>Bryant Van Zandt was as much surprised and displeased
as his brother had expected on the reception of the
letter announcing his marriage.</p>

<p>"Eliot had no right to do it. He promised our mother,
before she died, to stay single and care for the girls until
they had homes of their own!" he exclaimed, vexedly, to
his wife, to whom he imparted the shocking news before
breaking it to his sisters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Zandt was a blonde of the very palest type.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her skin it was milk-white,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her hair it was lint-white,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bright was the blue of her soft rolling eye."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She was about twenty-eight, but looked younger through
her fairness. She was rather pretty and petite, and, in her
tasteful garb of blue and white, looked like an animated
bisque doll.</p>

<p>But her color took a warmer tint than usual just now,
and frowning darkly, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It was a shame for Eliot to go and make such a goose
of himself. It would not have been so bad if he had married
a girl with money, as you did, but to go and add another
burden to the family is outrageous, I declare! What
ever will the girls say?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"They will be very angry, I am sure," said the lawyer;
but when it was told to them, they did not make as much
ado as their sister-in-law. They looked grave and sorry,
indeed, but Maud, the elder, said, sensibly:</p>

<p>"It is very bad, but indeed, Bryant, I do not see how
Eliot could have acted otherwise. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>, you
know."</p>

<p>It was the motto that had ruled the lives of the Van
Zandts for generations, and Bryant could not say one word;
but his wife made a little <i>moue</i> of disdain.</p>

<p>"<i>Noblesse oblige</i> has nothing to do with it," she said;
"or, if it had, it was the other way. He was bound to
stay free for your and Edith's sake."</p>

<p>Pretty Edith answered quickly:</p>

<p>"No, no, for we shall not want him to help pay for
our dresses much longer. Maud's book and my picture
are almost done, and if we sell them, we shall have money
of our own."</p>

<p>"<i>Châteaux en Espagne</i>!" Mrs. Van Zandt muttered
softly, with a covert sneer.</p>

<p>She had no talent only for looking pretty and dressing
well, and envied that of her more gifted sisters-in-law.</p>

<p>They were used to her sneers, and they winced, but seldom
retorted. The dreamy, dignified Maud looked out of
the window with a little sigh, and the more self-assertive
Edith exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There's no use crying over spilled milk, anyhow, and
Eliot's married for good and all. He has as much right
to bring his bride home as you had, Bryant, so we may as
well all make the best of it&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>"No one disputes his right, Edith, we only deplore his
imprudence," Bryant answered, flushing. "As for me, I
married a woman who would be no burden upon me, but
Eliot candidly owns that he has made a <i>mésalliance</i>."</p>

<p>"Married a pauper and a nobody!" flashed his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is no such thing. Let me see his letter. He did
not say that!" cried Edith, angrily.</p>

<p>"Not exactly in those words, but it amounts to the
same thing," Bryant Van Zandt answered. He threw her
the letter, and said impatiently: "Well, you may fight it
out among yourselves. I am going down-town."</p>

<p>He put on his hat and went out. Edith and Maud read
their brother's letter together. Its deprecatory, almost
pleading tone, touched their loyal young hearts.</p>

<p>"Poor Eliot, he could not help it. We must not
scold," said Edith. "This old house is big enough for us
all, isn't it, Maud?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered; but the sweet eyes were grave
with trouble as she fixed them on Mrs. Van Zandt. She
burst out suddenly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Sylvie, do not look so glum, please. Of course,
we do not like it, and neither did Eliot, I fancy; but you
must see there was no other way for a Van Zandt, so we
must make the best of it."</p>

<p>"Fancy a Van Zandt&mdash;one of the Van Zandts, of Boston&mdash;bringing
home an A B C school-girl as a bride!" was
the disdainful answer she received.</p>

<p>Vivacious Edith cried out tartly:</p>

<p>"You need not take on such airs, Sylvie. You are not
so learned yourself. New York girls never know anything
but dressing and flirting."</p>

<p>"We marry into poor, learned families, and so adjust
the difference," Mrs. Van Zandt replied, sarcastically.</p>

<p>Both the sisters flushed hotly at this coarse rejoinder.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Zandt had been generous with her money,
flinging it about her with the lavish hand of a spoiled
darling of Fortune; but she was always conscious of its importance,
never more so than when twitted with her execrable
French, her questionable time in music, and her
outrageous flirting, that sometimes drove poor Bryant wild
with jealousy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>And so to this household, with its discordant elements,
its supercilious mistress, its dreamy student, Maud, its enthusiastic,
artistic Edith, came Una with her impassioned
soul, her shy sensitiveness, her innocence and ignorance,
and her heritage of beauty, yet branded already "pauper
and nobody."</p>

<p>When she saw all those fair young faces grouped in the
handsome drawing-room to meet her, her heart thrilled
with timid delight. She had had so little to do all her life
with the young and gay.</p>

<p>All at once, as it were, she was thrown into a house full
of young and handsome people, and it was most pleasant.
With pretty confidence, quite untouched with self-assertion,
she received their greetings, kind on the part of the girls,
patronizing on that of Mrs. Van Zandt, and reserved as
regarded Bryant.</p>

<p>It was twilight when they arrived, and a cup of tea
awaited them before the late dinner. Una sipped hers
shyly under the fire of the strange eyes that were steadily
taking in her <i>tout ensemble</i>, the simple, tasteful gray dress,
the hat with gray feathers that seemed such a Quakerish
setting for the lovely unique face, with its somber, dark
eyes and slender, dark brows, its perfect chiseling, and its
aureole of rich golden hair.</p>

<p>"I shall paint her portrait," Edith whispered, in a
stage aside.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Bryant's wife was quite displeased when Eliot came
frankly to her to ask that a separate suite of rooms be provided
for his girlish bride.</p>

<p>"Do you hate her so much, then?" she queried, arching
her pale brows disagreeably.</p>

<p>He started and looked annoyed.</p>

<p>"Who said I hated her? You are very much mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
in the idea, Sylvie," he said, curtly. "I love Una quite
as well, I have no doubt, as Bryant loves you."</p>

<p>"Why, then&mdash;" she began, but he interrupted quickly:</p>

<p>"Simply because the love is all on one side yet. My
wife is wedded, yet not won. Her heart is that of a child
still, and although she bears my name, I will claim no
rights save a lover's until I win her woman's love."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bryant had only been acquainted with Una an
hour, but she could have told Eliot a different story from
that. Her quick eyes had seen the wealth of tenderness
in the dark orbs of Una as they rested now and then on
her husband's face, but Sylvie was more angry than any
one supposed over this unexpected marriage. She was not
unselfish enough to open the eyes of the blind young husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, if you choose to make a chivalrous
goose of yourself, Eliot," she answered, tartly, "I suppose
she can have the best suite of guest-rooms&mdash;the ones I have
been fixing up for my sister. But I can write a word to
Ida not to come."</p>

<p>"Of course you will not. There are other rooms," he
said, impatiently.</p>

<p>Sylvie shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Ida's used only to the best," she said, insolently.</p>

<p>He regarded her for a moment in stern silence. Underneath
his usual gentle, nonchalant manner slept a will that
was iron when needful. After a moment he said firmly:</p>

<p>"See here, Sylvie, my wife has the same right in my
father's old house that Bryant's wife has. You have the
best suite of rooms in the house, she must have the next
best. If you have put anything from your own purse into
the rooms, it can be removed into another room for Ida's
use when she comes. Una knows, for I have told her,
that the Van Zandts are poor&mdash;that we have nothing but
this big, old-fashioned house, and such a small income that
barely buys our sisters' dresses, and I have to eke out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the rest by hard work. She does not expect anything
luxurious, but I shall see that she has the best I can
afford."</p>

<p>So the gage was thrown down, and Sylvie picked it up
at once. She had the petty meanness to strip Una's
rooms of all the pretty things she had placed in them for
Ida, and they looked rather bare when she finished her
task of despoliation. But Maud and Edith brought the
prettiest things from their own rooms to fill up the void,
indignant at her petty spite.</p>

<p>"I know what is the matter. She is mad because she
can not marry Eliot to Ida now. It's what she's been
fishing for all the time," Edith said, indignantly; and the
sisters made a generous compact to fight the battles for
the new-comer that their clear young eyes already saw
were inevitable.</p>

<p>There was one person who took kindly at once to Una,
and that was the middle-aged governess, Mrs. Wilson.
When she had come first to teach the little Van Zandts,
she had been a forlorn young widow, having lately buried
her husband and her only child. She had taught Eliot
when a little lad, and she had taught his sisters, growing
gray in patient service of her well-beloved pupils. Now,
in the fair, innocent face and great, dark eyes of Eliot's
wife, she fancied a resemblance to the little daughter that
had been in Heaven so long.</p>

<p>"I shall love to teach her all that I can," she said, with
a dimness in her gentle brown eyes. "I love to look at
her beautiful face with those solemn eyes so much like my
dead Elsie's eyes."</p>

<p>And loving her first for Elsie's sake, she soon grew to
love her for her own. Never was there pupil so eager to
learn, so thirsty for knowledge, so untiring in application
as was the neglected Little Nobody, as Mrs. Van Zandt
still called her contemptuously in her thoughts.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>


<p>The first few months of Una's stay in her husband's
home passed quietly and uneventfully. Fortunately for
all concerned, Bryant's wife went off to spend the summer
at Long Branch with her mother and sister. In the generosity
of her heart, she took Bryant with her, so the household
that was left was very quiet and peaceable.</p>

<p>The girls took their summer vacation from study, and
Maud worked on her novel, Edith at her picture. In
the school-room Mrs. Wilson and Una diligently climbed
the ladder of knowledge through the long summer mornings.
In the afternoons the four ladies took long country
rides, and in the short evenings there were dinner and
Eliot. They had music always to enliven them, and very
often neighbors and friends dropped in and made the time
pass agreeably. Often Eliot, who, as a newspaper man,
had tickets to concerts, lectures, readings, and plays, took
them out to pleasant entertainments. He managed, too,
to buy Una a little brown pony to ride, and she had some
charming morning canters by the side of her husband,
who made the carriage-horse do service on his own behalf.</p>

<p>Sylvie Van Zandt would have said it was a humdrum
life, but Eliot and Una thoroughly enjoyed it. Nay, to
her it seemed an elysium, this bright home, with its kind,
friendly faces and gentle words, so unlike her life with
Mme. Lorraine.</p>

<p>Una had learned to read and write with perfect facility
and surprising ease, and passed on to higher studies. Of
French she already had some knowledge&mdash;indeed, as much
as she had of English, having spoken either at will in her
New Orleans home&mdash;so this language was very easy to acquire
now. For music she developed a talent equal to
that of her husband, and he was delighted to find that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
had a sweet, low alto voice that blended in perfect harmony
with his own.</p>

<p>She began to read poetry and novels now, and their
strange sweetness thrilled her very soul. She learned that
wonderful word, Love, and some of its subtler meanings.
It grew to be the theme of her thoughts and dreams,
although in the exquisite shyness that offset her child-like
frankness she never even named the word to Eliot.</p>

<p>But, for all that, she began to comprehend its mystic
meaning, and to say to herself, with deep tenderness:</p>

<p>"It is what Eliot feels for me and I for him."</p>

<p>Yet this blind young lover-husband said to himself
sometimes, discontentedly:</p>

<p>"She is very bright over other lessons, but very slow
learning the one I am trying to teach her so patiently every
day."</p>

<p>Every day she grew more beautiful and graceful under
the clever tuition of Mrs. Wilson, who delighted in her
task of forming the unformed girl. They spent happy
hours over the piano together, patient ones over books and
blackboards.</p>

<p>For several months she never even heard the words "A
Little Nobody," under which she had chafed so often at
Mme. Lorraine's. Life began to have a new, sweet meaning,
whose key-note was love.</p>

<p>She was so sorry when Eliot went away with his friendly
hand-clasp in the morning, so glad when he returned in
the evening. Sometimes she said to herself that she would
not have minded kissing him now, as Maud and Edith did
every morning; but, since the day when she promised to
marry him, and then rejected his kiss, he had never offered
another.</p>

<p>"I should not care for a cold, duty kiss," he thought.
"I will wait for her love and her kisses together."</p>

<p>In the meantime, he worked very hard at his literary
duties, trying to double the moderate salary he had enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
before his marriage, that his sisters might not feel the
change. The pony had been quite an extravagance, but
he had heard her express a timid wish for one, and by
some severe self-denial in the matter of coats and cigars,
had managed to gratify her wish. But he did not chafe
against the silent sacrifices he made for her sake. Each
one only made the dark-eyed girl dearer to his heart, and
the memory of that last day in madame's prison always
made him shudder and long to clasp her passionately to his
heart.</p>

<p>On his strong white arm there was a slight scar made by
the wound of a pocket-knife. He often looked at it when
alone, and said to himself:</p>

<p>"To that little scar my darling owes her life."</p>

<p>But Una, all unconscious of the debt, still sweetly
ignorant of his blindness, went on with her studies, and
her music, and her poetry reading, making him the hero
of all in her silent, adoring fashion.</p>

<p>There was one thing that touched and pleased him.</p>

<p>She had not forgotten one of the many songs with which
he had beguiled the dreariness of their imprisonment, and
she had insisted on learning each one. The two that she
liked best were "The Warrior Bold" and "Two Little
Lives." Mrs. Wilson and the girls noticed that she had
a fashion of humming over one little verse very often to
herself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It was a lark that sung in the heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">While all the world stood still to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Many a maiden looked from her knitting,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And in her heart there crept a tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Down came the lark and sung to the daisy,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Sung to it only songs of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till in the twilight slumbered the daisy,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Turning its sweet face to heaven above."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She never said to her young husband now, as she had
said that time in their prison, "You are the lark and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the little daisy," but she thought it all the more, and the
fanciful thought pleased her well.</p>

<p>Maud and Edith, who had first taken Una's part out of
generous loyalty to their brother, now began to like their
sister-in-law more for her own sake.</p>

<p>At first they said: "It is not so bad as we feared at
first. She is learning very fast, and she is really very
good and very pretty. And even although she is of
obscure origin, she is a Van Zandt now, and that is
enough."</p>

<p>Maud used to read her whole chapters of the wonderful
novel, and when Una's color rose and her eyes sparkled
with mirth or feeling, the young authoress was delighted.
She took it as a tribute to her genius, and was cheered and
encouraged in her delightful work. Edith, on her part,
appropriated the girl for a model, and made her pose for
her benefit every day in the little studio at the top of the
house. At last the two girls unanimously voted her a decided
acquisition.</p>

<p>"It is very fortunate Eliot had to marry her. She is a
darling, and I can see that they are beginning to fall in
love with each other," said Edith.</p>

<p>"I am so glad that it will turn out a love-match after
all," Maud replied, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The days came and went, and brought the early, bleak
New England autumn. It was time for Sylvie to come
home, but Bryant came alone. His wife had gone to New
York with her family to stay for the beginning of the
social season. Every one but her husband was secretly
pleased when she stayed until after the New-Year festivities.
Maud and Edith were quite sure that they had
got along more happily without her, although they were
too polite to hint such a thing to Bryant.</p>

<p>At last she came in the middle of January. Ida Hayes,
her sister, a younger edition of herself, came with her,
and straightway the halcyon days of Una came to an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Sylvie came to her room that evening, when she was
putting on her simple blue silk dress for dinner, with an
air of importance and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Have you come to your senses yet&mdash;you two?" she demanded,
brusquely. "If you have, I shall be glad, for I
do so want these rooms for Ida."</p>

<p>Una, with her laces all awry, looked up blankly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;think&mdash;I understand," she answered.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! I mean, do you use the same suite of rooms
as your husband?"</p>

<p>The pretty, wondering face did not change its color, the
dark eyes only looked amazed.</p>

<p>"Of course not," Una said, and Sylvie's red lips curled.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" she mimicked, sneeringly. "Why,
you silly child, you talk very strangely. Bryant and I
share the same suite of rooms, do we not? All husbands
and wives do who love each other."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>


<p>Una commenced to fasten her laces with strangely
trembling fingers.</p>

<p>"Eliot and I love each other!" she said, slowly.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed?" said Sylvie, with a very incredulous
giggle. "You did not when I went away. Have you
done your courting since, as you had no time for it before
you were married?"</p>

<p>The wonder, the half-dazed comprehension in the girl's
pale face ought to have made her less pitiless, but it had
been her dream and Bryant's to marry Ida to Eliot. She
had said to herself many times that she could never forgive
the Little Nobody that had thwarted her plans.</p>

<p>So with an angry heart and pitiless eyes she had thrust
the point of a dagger into Una's heart.</p>

<p>But with proud, somber eyes the girl-wife said, gravely:</p>

<p>"You said you wanted these rooms for Miss Hayes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Very well, you can have them. I dare say Maud will give
me another room."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no, I would not turn you out of your room
for the world, child!" suavely. She knew that Eliot
would not permit it. "I only thought that if you had
given them up and gone to Eliot's these would suit Ida.
She always had them when she came before, and it does
seem foolish, does it not, for man and wife to occupy six
rooms when three would be enough? I hoped you and
Eliot had become reconciled to your forced marriage ere
this."</p>

<p>Driven to bay, Una cried out, angrily:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Van Zandt, you are talking the wildest nonsense.
There was no forced marriage."</p>

<p>"Then why did Eliot write such a letter to my husband?
Come to my room, I will show it to you since you
dispute my word."</p>

<p>She caught Una's cold hand and half dragged her with
her to her own room, where behind locked doors she gave
the ignorant wife that fatal letter to read&mdash;fatal, because
in Eliot's haste and worry he had stated only the bare
facts of the case, and Una could not read between the lines
the love that had filled his heart.</p>

<p>She read it&mdash;the lovely, trusting girl&mdash;every word. She
comprehended it in part. What she could not fathom
Sylvie pointed out in clearest language, and when she had
made her cruel meaning clear as day, she said, maliciously:</p>

<p>"<i>Noblesse oblige</i>!"</p>

<p>A gasp, and the girl's heavy eyes turned dumbly on her
face&mdash;dumb with a bitter, humble humiliation. Sylvie
said, half deprecatingly:</p>

<p>"He did not love you at first, of course. How could
he? When he came he asked me to give you a separate
suite. I remonstrated, but he insisted. Of course I
thought you would win him while I was away, and he
would get over his foolishness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Una had folded her white arms on the dressing-table,
and was looking into her face with dazed, heavy eyes. She
muttered, hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Oh, this is too dreadful! What must he, what must
you all think of me?"</p>

<p>Sylvie replied, with cruel frankness:</p>

<p>"Of course we all felt angry with you at first. We were
disappointed, too, for we had all expected that he would
marry sister Ida. There had been no engagement, but it
was understood. But there, no one blames you or him,
child. As I said before, Eliot could not have acted any
other way. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>!"</p>

<p>As if forgetful of her presence, Una murmured, sadly:</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! what shall I do?"</p>

<p>Sylvie answered, with more sense than she had displayed
in making these cruel revelations:</p>

<p>"Do? Why, nothing but make the best of it, as Eliot
and the rest of us have done. What has happened can not
be altered now, so you must try to make him fond of you,
so that he shall no longer regret taking you and losing Ida;
and, for one thing, you ought not to be so extravagant.
There is that pony he bought you. I know he could not
afford it, really, for he is poor. And to-night I saw him
bring you hot-house flowers. I am afraid he is running
into debt just to pamper your whims. Now, if he had
married Ida, it would have been different. She would have
brought him a fortune, and could have paid her own bills."</p>

<p>Pale as she would ever be in her coffin, Una stood listening,
her heart beating wildly.</p>

<p>"I am in his way. Oh, I wish I could die now!" she
was thinking wildly.</p>

<p>Sylvie, who had done all this out of sheer malice, gloated
over the sight of her misery.</p>

<p>To herself she said spitefully:</p>

<p>"I am paying her back, the little pauper and nobody,
for Ida's disappointment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Then suddenly she remembered that it was almost dinner-time.
She said carelessly:</p>

<p>"You had better go back to your room and finish dressing,
Una; and remember, I would not have told you what
I have, only that you disputed my word. I hope you will
not run to Edith with it. It will only make matters
worse. I dare say he will learn to love you in time."</p>

<p>"I shall run to no one with it," Una answered, in a
strange voice. She moved to the door as she spoke, and
passed out. Sylvie laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>"I have paid Eliot now for his insolence. I know he
loves her to madness. I saw it in his eyes when she met
him so coolly this evening. Well, this will put a stumbling-block
between them that he will not easily pass."</p>

<p>And humming an opera air with heartless indifference,
she made some slight addition to her already elaborate
toilet, and went down-stairs.</p>

<p>Una's toilet, the light-blue surah silk with square neck
and elbow-sleeves, was complete but for the handsome
corsage bouquet Eliot had brought her an hour ago. She
did not pin it on her breast; she took it in her hand and
ran along the hall, then tapped softly at the door of the
apartment that she knew had been designed for Miss
Hayes's use.</p>

<p>Ida opened it, dazzling Una's eyes with the glitter of
her satin and jewels. She frowned slightly at the intruder.</p>

<p>"I have brought you these flowers to wear," Una said,
rapidly, thrusting them into Ida's white hand. Then she
turned away and went along the hall with slow, lagging
footsteps, down the broad, shallow staircase, and so to the
drawing-room, her young face pale with emotion, and a
strange, excited glitter in her dark eyes.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>


<p>Eliot was sitting on a low <i>tête-à-tête</i>. He moved aside
slightly to allow her room at his side.</p>

<p>But Una did not seem to see her husband's involuntary
movement. She went to the opposite side of the room and
sat down by Edith, who, with her brown hair and brown
eyes, looked very pretty in garnet velvet and cashmere
daintily combined into a graceful dinner-dress. Maud was
buried in a book on the other side of her, but she had
taken time to honor the new arrivals by putting on her best
black silk with a white lace fichu to relieve its somber tone.</p>

<p>Vivacious Edith exclaimed instantly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Una, the pretty flowers that Eliot brought you&mdash;you
have forgotten to wear them. Shall I run and get
them for you?"</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;but no," as Edith rose. "I don't care
for them. I&mdash;I have given them away."</p>

<p>Eliot had heard distinctly the question and answer; but
there was no time for comment. Ida Hayes sailed in&mdash;a
bisque doll in Nile-green silk and velvet, with Eliot's roses
pinned among the laces of her V-shaped corsage.</p>

<p>"And to think that I went without cigars two days to
buy Ida Hayes a corsage bouquet!" he said, ruefully, to
himself.</p>

<p>But the loss of the cigars was the least part of his mortification.</p>

<p>He had fancied he was winning his way to his girl-bride's
heart. This little incident showed him clearly his
mistake.</p>

<p>"She is not learning to love me. Perhaps she never
will," he thought, gloomily.</p>

<p>Ida Hayes, with the best grace in the world, sat down
on the <i>tête-à-tête</i> beside him. She was a belle and a beauty&mdash;had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
been for seven years, ever since she left the school-room
at eighteen&mdash;and she could have been married well
long ago, but she had seen no one she fancied until she
met Eliot Van Zandt at her sister's wedding three years
ago. Since then her heart, as well as Sylvie's, had been
set on an alliance with him, and his marriage had been a
bitter blow to her self-love.</p>

<p>But she was a society woman. She did not wear her
heart on her sleeve, and in the clear, pale-blue eyes upraised
to his Eliot Van Zandt read no sign of her disappointed
hopes.</p>

<p>"I see you looking at my flowers. That dear little
thing, your wife, gave them to me," she said, carelessly.</p>

<p>He answered as carelessly:</p>

<p>"Yes, and they harmonize well with your dress."</p>

<p>But in his heart he longed to tear them from her breast
and trample them beneath his feet. They had taught him
a bitter lesson&mdash;one he would not soon forget.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced, and he took Ida into the dining-room.
Bryant gave Sylvie his arm, and Una followed with
her sisters-in-law, hiding with a smile her pain at the preference
Eliot had shown Miss Hayes.</p>

<p>"How he must hate me, for he can not help thinking
that but for me he would not have lost her. It was right
to give her the flowers. She had really the best right to
them," she said miserably to herself.</p>

<p>The flowers, the lights, the china and silver of the well-appointed
table flashed confusedly before her eyes. She
could see nothing clearly but the pretty wax-doll face of
Miss Hayes as she sat opposite to Eliot and talked to him
incessantly.</p>

<p>Glancing up and down the long table at the fair faces
of the five ladies, she said, gayly:</p>

<p>"Two gentlemen and five ladies! Only two have
cavaliers. There are three of us too many."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Una thought, with keen shame and inexpressible bitterness:</p>

<p>"Only one too many, and that one is poor little me!"</p>

<p>She made a great effort to eat, and swallowed some
food, although it half choked her; but as soon as they rose
from the table she slipped away and went up to the school-room,
where Mrs. Wilson, whose impaired digestion abhorred
late dinners, was placidly taking some milk and
oatmeal by way of supper.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, have you got a fever? Your eyes shine
so brightly, and your cheeks are quite flushed!" exclaimed
the good governess, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I am not sick; I dare say I am excited. There is
company, you know, and I thought I should not be missed
if I stole away up here with you," Una answered, with
affected carelessness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson smiled on her pupil, and answered, kindly:</p>

<p>"I'm glad you came, dear; but, of course, you will be
missed. Your husband would miss you, if there was a
room full of company."</p>

<p>Una answered in a strange tone:</p>

<p>"No, not to-night; for Miss Ida Hayes is there."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson put down her glass of milk and looked
curiously at the speaker. She began to comprehend the
cause of her strange looks and words. She said to herself:</p>

<p>"This pretty little girl-bride has grown jealous of some
meaningless attention of Eliot to Miss Hayes. She loves
her husband, and the boy is somehow too stupid to see it,
or, perhaps, he does not care. I would speak to him, but
I do not like to meddle in so delicate an affair."</p>

<p>Aloud, she said gently:</p>

<p>"I like to have you up here with me, but your husband
and friends will think I am selfish, dear; so you had better
go back to the drawing-room. Miss Ida Hayes is not
charming enough to make up to Eliot for your absence."</p>

<p>Una turned around suddenly and looked at her gravely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, then; I will go, since you don't want me;
but I shall go to my own room," she said.</p>

<p>And she did, and there Edith found her, pretending to
read, when she came to seek her half an hour later.</p>

<p>"You selfish child! put down your book. We are
going to have some music, and we want your alto," she
said.</p>

<p>"I can not sing to-night; my head aches," Una answered;
and none of Edith's arguments could alter her refusal.
She was obliged to go down alone and make excuses
for her sister-in-law.</p>

<p>"She has a headache, and can not come down," she
said; and Sylvie laughed in her sleeve.</p>

<p>"She is jealous of Ida," she thought, maliciously.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p>The rest of the family were already assembled at breakfast
when Una entered the dining room the next morning,
pale and grave-looking, after a wretched, sleepless night.
Her place by Eliot was waiting for her, although she had
half expected it would be filled by Ida Hayes.</p>

<p>Eliot had been watching for her anxiously, and his
glance was very tender, despite the episode of last night.</p>

<p>"I hope your head is better," he said, kindly; and looking
at him with a smile of wonderful sweetness, she answered:</p>

<p>"It is well, thank you."</p>

<p>In the long vigil of last night she had formed a noble
resolve to win her husband's heart, and to make up to him
by her womanly sweetness for all he had sacrificed in marrying
her, a nameless girl of obscure birth.</p>

<p>Sylvie's hints had not been lost upon her. She determined
that she would not allow Eliot to be so extravagant
for her sake again. The brown pony must be sold, the
hot-house flowers must not be bought. She would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
no more new dresses. She would not be a burden on him
she loved.</p>

<p>"Chocolate, Una?" asked Mrs. Van Zandt, who was
presiding at the silver urn with graceful ease. She filled
the china cup for the girl, laughing the while in secret at
her pale, wistful face.</p>

<p>"It was a hard blow to her pride," she said to herself,
exultantly; then she turned her attention again to her husband,
who had been reading from the morning paper when
Una's entrance interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Our old favorite on the boards again. It will be a
treat," said Sylvie. "On what night did you say, Bryant?"</p>

<p>"The sixteenth; that will be three nights off," he answered.</p>

<p>"Exactly. We will all go. We will make up a theater-party.
What do you say, girls?"</p>

<p>"Splendid!" said Edith.</p>

<p>"All right!" exclaimed Ida, and Maud added a more
sedate affirmative.</p>

<p>"And you, dear?" Eliot said, gently, to the silent girl
by his side.</p>

<p>She lifted her dark, mournful eyes to his face with a
gentle smile, and said, wistfully, almost humbly:</p>

<p>"Whatever you wish, Eliot."</p>

<p>The sweetness of her smile and voice disarmed his resentment
for her slight of last night, and leaning toward
her, he said, in a tender whisper:</p>

<p>"We will go, then, and I will bring you another bouquet;
but mind, no giving it away this time."</p>

<p>"Did you care?" she murmured back, with sudden
radiance.</p>

<p>They were rising from the table just then, and Una
slipped her white fingers daringly through his arm, as she
murmured the coquettish words. He looked down, saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the sudden radiance on her face, and a half-light broke
upon his mind.</p>

<p>"So you did it to make me jealous, madame?" he said,
gayly. "Very well; you attained your desire. But I
must be off now. Come to the library one minute. I
want you."</p>

<p>Inside the cozy little room, he said, kindly:</p>

<p>"You will want a new dress for the theater-party.
How much?"</p>

<p>She drew back from him, scarlet with shame.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I have plenty of dresses&mdash;more than I need."</p>

<p>"Very well, but you shall have a new dress if you wish
it."</p>

<p>"But I do not wish it," hurriedly. "And&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
Eliot, I'm afraid I cost you too much money! Sell the
brown pony. I do not care for riding any more, and it is
a useless expense to keep it."</p>

<p>His fair, handsome face grew suddenly stern.</p>

<p>"Who has been putting such nonsense in your head?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"It is not nonsense," Una said, shyly but firmly.
"You are poor. You told me so long ago. So I know
you can not afford the expense."</p>

<p>"Nonsense&mdash;" he began; but the door opened, and
Maud entered, followed by Edith.</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse us, Una. We did not know you were
here with Eliot. We just came in to say good-morning to
him before we go in the drawing-room with Ida."</p>

<p>He kissed them both, and they went out. He held out
his hand to his wife.</p>

<p>"By-by, Una. I suppose I must really tear myself
away," he said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>


<p>She put her small hand in his, and he felt the fingers
curl around his own, gently detaining him.</p>

<p>"Well, dear?" he asked, thinking that she was about
to change her mind and say she would have the new dress.</p>

<p>Her face dropped a little to hide the warm flush that
rose over it as she stammered in desperate confusion:</p>

<p>"Before you&mdash;go&mdash;I must make a confession. Last
night I&mdash;I&mdash;told an untruth when I said I had a headache
and could not sing. You&mdash;you will not call me your little
Una, your lady of truth any more now, will you, Eliot?"</p>

<p>She was so close to him, the supple, girlish figure leaned
so near that he daringly slipped his arm around the small
waist. A thrill of rapture ran through him as he felt her
nestle shyly in his clasp.</p>

<p>"So it was not a headache, my little Truth?" he whispered,
lovingly. "What was the reason then that made
you desert us all so unkindly?"</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;was&mdash;a fit of ill-temper," Una exclaimed,
remorsefully; then she turned round, so quickly, so lightly,
he did not realize it until it was over, and slipping her arm
around his neck drew his face down to hers, pressed a
light, bashful kiss upon his lips, then tore herself from his
clasp and fled the room.</p>

<p>Strong man as he was, Eliot Van Zandt reeled backward
into a chair, dizzy with delicious rapture at that light, shy
but ardent pressure of Una's lips upon his own.</p>

<p>It had come so unexpectedly, that moment of bliss after
the bitterness and hopelessness of last night, it was like the
dawning of a new day after a night of storm and darkness.</p>

<p>Hope plumed her wings again in his heart.</p>

<p>"She is going to learn to love me," he thought, happily,
too blind still to understand the full meaning of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
caress that had sent such a shock of rapturous delight
through his whole being.</p>

<p>He sat still a few blissful moments, going gladly over
her looks and words.</p>

<p>"Not a headache&mdash;a fit of ill-temper. Ill-temper over
what?" he wondered, then suddenly: "Oh, my little love,
my darling, you were vexed because Ida Hayes sat down
by my side, because I took her in to dinner. Well, I shall
bless the coming of Ida if through her coquetry my Una
learns she has a heart."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, frightened at her own boldness, her heart
beating furiously, Una rushed upstairs, seeking solitude in
which to hide herself from all.</p>

<p>"What must he think of me?" she murmured, with
crimson blushes. "I did not mean to do it. I do not
know how I dared so much. Was he angry, I wonder? I
could not look at him. I was so amazed at what I had
done!"</p>

<p>Her lips burned with the touch of his, her heart throbbed
with pain and pleasure commingled. Walking restlessly
up and down the floor, she murmured:</p>

<p>"I love him so dearly that I must&mdash;I must win his
heart! Then, and not till then, will he forgive me for the
loss of Ida and her fortune. How shamed I felt over the
proffer of the new dress! He will give me new dresses,
but he will not give me his heart. He puts me away from
him like a stranger. Shall I resent it? Ah, no, no; since
he has sacrificed so much for me, I must sacrifice my pride
for him. For his own sake, for his future happiness; I,
the Little Nobody, obscure, unloved, penniless, uncultured,
must make myself beloved by him until he shall bless
the wayward fate that made him mine."</p>

<p>The dark eyes glowed, the cheeks crimsoned with emotion,
as Una thought, passionately:</p>

<p>"I would that I could do some brave, noble, heroic
deed that would challenge the world's admiration, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
he would forget my obscure origin and my misfortune that
drove him to the sacrifice that saved me from the world's
scorn, in sudden pride and love for me!"</p>

<p>There was a light tap at the door. Mrs. Wilson had
sent Edith to bring her tardy pupil to the school-room.</p>

<p>"If you are sick, or otherwise engaged, she will readily
excuse you," Edith said.</p>

<p>"I do not want to be excused," said Una, as she hurried
to the presence of the gentle governess.</p>

<p>But that day she found books and lessons irksome in
the extreme. Her heart and mind were full of the strange
facts she had heard last night from the lips of Sylvie.</p>

<p>She who had been wedded, yet no wife, for almost
a year had only now found out that she was unloved, and
the humiliation weighed her almost to the earth, in spite
of her brave, sensible resolve to win Eliot yet, and make
him forget that once he had sighed for Ida Hayes.</p>

<p>She longed to throw down the irksome books and cry
out to the gentle, placid Mrs. Wilson: "Away with books!
Teach me the only lesson that interests me now&mdash;how to
win my husband's heart!"</p>

<p>She beat back the yearning impulse to claim this gentle
woman's sympathy with bitter pride.</p>

<p>"Shall I complain of him to her, to any one?" she
thought. "Ah, no; it lies between us two and God! The
bitter secret shall never pass my lips! Secret, did I say?
Alas! it is known to them all, has been known all along.
How they must pity me, the unloved wife, the perhaps
unwelcome intruder in the home to which they had hoped
he would bring Ida Hayes a loved and loving bride!"</p>

<p>It did not look as if she was unwelcome when at the
close of study hours Maud and Edith burst into the room.</p>

<p>"Una, we are just dying to get hold of you!" Edith
cried. "We want to talk about the theater-party. What
are we going to wear, for I'm sure we can not afford new
dresses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"And we want to look as nice as possible, for Ida and
Sylvie will do all they can to outshine us," added Maud.
"Of course they have lots of new things, so Edith and I
have just made up our minds to have some of the pretty
things in mamma's trunks upstairs. She gave them to us
long before she died. So if you won't be offended, Una,
dear, come with us, and we'll find something that we can
fix over for the theater-party."</p>

<p>"What is it all about?" queried gentle Mrs. Wilson,
and Edith returned:</p>

<p>"A popular actress who left the stage almost sixteen
years ago has returned to it again, and they say she is as
young, lovely, and spirited as when she retired to marry a
rich aristocrat. All paint, of course, but Sylvie is just
wild to have us go and see her play on Thursday night."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>Una went with the girls to ransack the trunks, but she
steadily declined to accept any of the finery they spread
out on the bed and chairs.</p>

<p>"Eliot offered to give me a new dress this morning, and
I told him I had plenty," she said, "so if I took any of
these, he would think I had deceived him."</p>

<p>"You dear little conscientious thing, you are well named
Una," cried Edith, gayly. "But Eliot would never know,
and, my dear, this rose-colored satin with lace flounces
would make up lovely for you, and be so becoming."</p>

<p>"It is too fine for me," Una answered, shrinkingly.</p>

<p>"Not a bit. A gold dress would not be too fine for
Eliot's wife," vivaciously. "And you know, dear, at a
theater-party one dresses as if for a ball. We shall have
private boxes, you know, and every one will want to look
nice. Now, you really have nothing fit to wear."</p>

<p>Una flushed sensitively, but she knew that it was true.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
She had nothing fine but the blue silk dinner-dress, except&mdash;and
her heart throbbed painfully&mdash;the sweet, white dress
with its filmy laces that she had worn for her strange marriage
that starlit night in New Orleans beneath the green
trees in the quaint semi-tropical garden. The dress, with
the necklace of pearls, lay folded away in the bottom of
her trunk.</p>

<p>"I have the white dress I wore when I was&mdash;married,"
she said, dubiously. "Perhaps it will do."</p>

<p>They went with her to look at it, and they were charmed
with the quaint, pretty robe and the moon-white pearls.</p>

<p>"You will look lovely in this. Why did you not show
it to us before? And you never told us you had such
splendid jewels."</p>

<p>"Are they splendid? I did not know it. Monsieur
Carmontelle gave them to me for a wedding-gift. I have
more of them in a box given me by the Jockey Club."</p>

<p>They exclaimed with delight when they saw the lovely
things in the jewel-casket. There were diamonds, rubies,
emeralds, all in the most tasteful and elegant settings.
Una gave them <i>carte blanche</i> to wear what they pleased,
and accepting the offer in sisterly sincerity, the girls
selected each a set appropriate to the costume selected for
the occasion.</p>

<p>"You will wear the pearls with the white dress, Una, I
will take the diamonds to suit the rose-colored satin, and
Maud can wear the rubies with the gold brocade!" exclaimed
Edith, gayly. "Oh, how surprised Sylvie and
Ida will be! They will expect us to look like dowdies,
knowing we can not afford new dresses. But we will
keep all a secret, and burst upon them Thursday evening
in a blaze of glory!"</p>

<p>"Agreed!" cried Maud, merrily, and Una's gentle,
pensive smile added assent, although to herself she sighed
apprehensively:</p>

<p>"Perhaps Eliot will not like for me to appear in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
wedding-dress. It will remind him of his sacrifice. But
I have nothing else to wear."</p>

<p>And when Eliot asked her that evening what kind of a
dress she would wear, so that he might select her flowers
in keeping, she answered, in a half-frightened tone.</p>

<p>"White!"</p>

<p>"It will suit you," he answered, kindly, but Una
thought, sadly:</p>

<p>"He would not say so if he knew it was my wedding-dress!"</p>

<p>He lingered by her side, thrilled with the memory of the
morning's kiss, and waiting to see if she would show him
any more kindness.</p>

<p>Una was very glad to keep him near her, but she was
full of a blushing consciousness that made her even more
shy than usual. Oh, that kiss this morning!&mdash;how had she
dared to be so bold?&mdash;and yet she had a passionate longing
to repeat the caress.</p>

<p>Ida Hayes saw him lingering by his wife, and called him
away to sing with her.</p>

<p>"That duet we used to sing, you know," she said; and
her familiar tone and coquettish smile half maddened Una
with pain. She drew back without a word, and let Eliot
pass her, and between Sylvie and her sister he had no more
chance to speak to her in the drawing-room that evening.
When the music was done he was drawn into a game of
chess, and as Una was ignorant of the game she was perforce
left out. She sat apart and talked to some callers
who had dropped in, and when they left she was only too
glad to find that the evening was over and the family were
separated for the night.</p>

<p>She went upstairs very slowly, and along the carpeted
hall to her room, with a bitter sense of loneliness and disappointment,
vaguely comprehending the malice of the
two women who had so cleverly kept Eliot from her side
all the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>"They hate me for my unconscious fault," she thought,
miserably.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Una," a voice said, suddenly, almost at
her side.</p>

<p>It was Eliot who had followed her upstairs. As she
turned round her white, startled face, he drew her hand in
his arm and walked with her toward her door.</p>

<p>"You forgot to tell me good-night," he said, smiling.
"Or&mdash;did you deliberately snub me again because of&mdash;a
fit of ill-temper?"</p>

<p>Too truthful to deny the imputation, she said, bashfully:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. I thought Miss Hayes wasn't going to
let you off long enough to say good-night, so I came away."</p>

<p>Pressing her little hand very close against his side, he
replied, ardently:</p>

<p>"I should like to see the Miss Hayes that could keep
me from saying good-night to my darling little wife."</p>

<p>They had reached her door. She paused, trembling
with delight, but in the dim light he could not see the
gladness in the beautiful dark eyes. He only felt the
trembling of the form beside him, and thought that she
was nervous and frightened.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid of me, Una," he said, hurriedly, and
with sharp disappointment. Then he drew the little figure
close to his heart, and held her there a moment, while he
pressed on her warm lips the ardent kiss of a lover. A
moment more he turned away and left her to enter her
room alone, with some sweet, passionate words ringing in
her ears:</p>

<p>"Good-night, my darling, my little wife! Sleep well,
and dream of your own Eliot."</p>

<p>"Did he mean it? Is he learning to love me at last?"
she whispered to herself, sobbing wildly with hysterical
delight, and trembling with bashful pleasure. She unrobed
and lay down on her dainty white bed, not to sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
but to live over and over again, in fancy, his tender looks
and words and his warm caress.</p>

<p>But Eliot, in whom a passionate hope and longing had
been stirring all day, went to his solitary room vaguely
disappointed.</p>

<p>"Poor darling! I frightened her by my vehemence,"
he said, remorsefully, to himself. "Her beauty and her
gentleness tempted me almost beyond my strength. Ah,
she little dreamed what a struggle it cost to leave her there
and to wait, still wait, although half maddened with love
and longing."</p>

<p>For him, too, the drowsy god tarried to-night, and he
tossed sleeplessly on his pillow, dreaming of Una just as
Una was dreaming of him, with infinite love and yearning.</p>

<p>Weary with the night's restlessness, Una slept too
soundly next morning for the breakfast-bell to rouse her
from her slumbers. Eliot, who had to be at the office by
a certain hour, fidgeted uneasily, and at last sent Edith to
see if she was awake.</p>

<p>In a minute she came out on tiptoe.</p>

<p>"She is sleeping so sweetly, I had not the heart to wake
her," she said. "But, Eliot, you might just slip in and
kiss her good-bye in her sleep."</p>

<p>Her keen young eyes saw the sensitive color mount to
his temples.</p>

<p>"Una would not like it," he replied, gravely.</p>

<p>Candid Edith shut the door softly behind her, and gave
her brother a playful little shake as she went with him
along the hall.</p>

<p>"Eliot, you are a great goose, that's what you are!"
she cried. "Una is your wife. You have a right to go
in her room and kiss her if you like, and I don't believe
she would object, either!"</p>

<p>With a sigh, he replied:</p>

<p>"You must remember how sudden our marriage was,
Edith. My little girl had no time to learn to love me, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
get used to me. Is it not right that I should leave her in
peace until I shall have won her heart as well as her
hand?"</p>

<p>Edith stared at him in wonder.</p>

<p>"Eliot Van Zandt, you are as blind as a bat!" she exclaimed,
and darted away without another word.</p>

<p>But although she would not say another word to Eliot,
she made up her mind to lecture Una.</p>

<p>So the first thing when Una opened her heavy eyes, she
saw Edith sitting demurely in the big willow rocker by the
bedside.</p>

<p>She burst out unceremoniously:</p>

<p>"You lazy girl, you have slept until breakfast was over,
and your husband gone down-town. Poor boy! he waited
and waited outside your door for you to wake, but you
just dreamed on until he had to go. I told him to slip in
and kiss you good-bye in your sleep, but he was afraid you
would be angry. I do say, Una Van Zandt, you ought to
be ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>Una was sitting up in bed very wide awake indeed now,
a lovely picture of amazement and distress, with her loose,
golden hair falling on her half-bare, white shoulders, her
eyes dilated with wonder, her cheeks flushed from sleep.</p>

<p>"Oh, Edith, what have I done now? I don't know
what you're talking about," she faltered.</p>

<p>"Don't you, Mistress Van Zandt? Listen, then: I'm
talking about what a tyrant you are to my brother. Here
you have been married to him almost a year and I don't
believe you've ever given the poor boy as much as a kiss
or one fond word. Do you think he is a stick or a stone,
without any feeling, that you behave so heartlessly? I tell
you it made me angry to see him this morning afraid to
come inside this room to tell you good-bye. Don't you
know he has a right to be in this room with you if he
choose, only he is too afraid of you to assert himself?
There is no other man on earth half so good and chivalrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
as Eliot. Fancy Bryant being afraid to put his foot inside
Sylvie's door. Why, they both would tell you it was
all nonsense. You treat Eliot&mdash;"</p>

<p>Una held out her hands entreatingly.</p>

<p>"Hush, Edith, don't scold me so," she begged, with
quivering lips; but she did not utter a word in her own defense.
She was too wretched and heart-sick, feeling that
Eliot's fault, his persistent avoidance of his wife, need not
be held up to his sister's condemnation.</p>

<p>"Far rather would I shield him by letting the blame
rest wholly upon myself," she resolved, firmly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>


<p>Sylvie pretended to be very anxious that day over the
appearance her sisters-in-law would make at the theater-party.</p>

<p>"Have you anything new?" she inquired. "Because
I have invited several young ladies and gentlemen, and
ordered a supper here after the performance at the theater.
Of course, I want you all to do credit to Bryant."</p>

<p>"We haven't a new thing," declared Edith, lugubriously.
"You and Ida will have to uphold the honor of
the family by your elegant dressing, for Maud and I will
be sure to look like dowdies."</p>

<p>Mme. Sylvie did not seem to take the information much
to heart. She said carelessly:</p>

<p>"And Eliot's wife?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she will be a dowdy, too," replied roguish Edith.</p>

<p>So Sylvie and Ida could scarcely believe their eyes that
evening when Maud and Edith sallied in, the dark-haired
Maud in gold-colored satin, red roses, and rubies, and
Edith in lustrous rose-color with white lace flounces, while
diamonds flashed from her throat and ears. Both girls
looked as handsome in their way as the bisque dolls who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
were splendid in Parisian toilets and a profusion of gleaming
jewels.</p>

<p>Sylvie stared in amaze and jealous displeasure.</p>

<p>"You told me you had nothing fit to wear!" she exclaimed,
acrimoniously.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&mdash;nothing new," Edith replied,
dimpling with mischief. "These are our mother's old
dresses made over."</p>

<p>"But diamonds and rubies&mdash;I am sure Bryant told me
that all your mother's jewels were sold to help pay your
father's debts when he failed!" Sylvie exclaimed, in wonderment
and displeasure.</p>

<p>"So they were," Maud answered. "But, Sylvie, these
do not belong to us. We borrowed them from Una."</p>

<p>Ida Hayes broke in with inexpressible anger and spite:</p>

<p>"I thought Eliot was too poor to give such jewels to his
wife."</p>

<p>Edith flashed her a glance of scorn.</p>

<p>"Fortunately poverty is no disgrace, Ida," she said.
"But Eliot did not give them to Una. They were bridal
presents from her Southern friends."</p>

<p>"Dear me, Sylvie! and you said she was poor and a nobody!"
Ida exclaimed, insolently, turning around to her
sister.</p>

<p>"Eliot said so," Sylvie answered; and forthwith there
began a war of words that was fortunately stopped by
Bryant's entrance, and his instant laying on the table of
the heated subject of debate.</p>

<p>On his part he was glad to see his young sisters so
charmingly dressed and looking so lovely. He took the
exciting fact of Una's jewels with manly equanimity.</p>

<p>"There is no reason why Una should not have them,"
he said. "Her adopted father, Pierre Carmontelle, is one
of the richest men in the South. If he and his friends
gave her costly bridal presents, it was no more than she
had a right to expect."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Sylvie and Ida dared say no more, but their thoughts
were full of rancor, and the former muttered, <i>sotto voce</i>:</p>

<p>"I suppose she will come down presently covered with
diamonds!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, quite a different scene was transpiring in
Una's room upstairs. Fifteen minutes ago, as she had
stood before her mirror, putting the last touches to her
sweet, simple toilet, there had come a light, quick rap at
her door.</p>

<p>"Maud or Edith," she thought, and called out, carelessly:
"Come in!"</p>

<p>The door opened softly, and Eliot, her husband, appeared
on the threshold, looking marvelously handsome in
full evening-dress, a bouquet of pure white flowers in one
hand, a long, white box in the other.</p>

<p>When he saw lovely Una standing there in the soft,
white robe, with the pearls around her bare, white throat,
and her round arms uncovered, save by the dainty white
gloves, her dark eyes shining with innocent joy at her own
fairness, he uttered a cry of delight:</p>

<p>"Oh, Una, how angelic you look! But," dubiously,
"do I intrude?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, with a blush and tremor; so
Eliot shut the door and came to her side.</p>

<p>"I have brought you some flowers and an opera-cloak,"
he said, pulling it out of the box and dropping it on her
shoulders. It was a dainty white cashmere affair, not
costly but very pretty, with a shining fringe of pearl and
silver beads. With the white dress and flowers, it made
Una look bride-like and lovely as a dream.</p>

<p>"Does it suit you? Will it be warm enough?" he
asked, with shining eyes; and Una held out her hands to
him with sudden tears on her lashes.</p>

<p>"Oh, how good you are to me, who should expect so
little from you! How can I ever requite your kindness?"
she murmured, tremulously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>He caught the white hands in his, and drew the dainty
white figure into the clasp of his yearning arms.</p>

<p>"Only love me, my darling!" he whispered, passionately,
against her crimson cheek. "That will pay all."</p>

<p>She lay still, trembling with rapture in the close pressure
of his fond arms. She felt his kisses falling softly, warmly
on her face, her lips, her hair. At last she drew herself
from him, saying, with rapturous wonder:</p>

<p>"You really want me to love you, Eliot?"</p>

<p>Half smiling at her wondering tone, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What a strange question, Una! Have I not been
waiting almost a year for your heart to wake from its
childish sleep and respond to mine? And how else could
you requite aught I have done for you? Do you not know,
my darling, that love must be paid in its own coin?"</p>

<p>Doubting, wondering, she looked up into those glorious
blue-gray orbs now full of a radiant fire impossible to describe.
Something of the truth dawned on her bewildered
soul. She cried out impulsively:</p>

<p>"Oh, Eliot, then you do love me? And I have been so
wretched, so afraid, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>No more, for he had caught her in his arms, crushing
her passionately to his breast, whispering that he had loved
her always, always, and had grown so weary, so impatient
waiting to win her heart.</p>

<p>"There was no need to wait if you had not been so
blind," answered truthful Una. "For I loved you, Eliot,
from the very first!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>


<p>If Edith had not come upstairs to see what kept Una
dressing so long, they would have forgotten all about the
theater-party in their absorption of each other. As it was,
they started apart in surprise when she came softly in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Eliot, I did not know you were here," she said,
drawing back.</p>

<p>"Come in, Edith, and congratulate us," he said, drawing
Una to his side again. "We have just found out that
we are in love with each other."</p>

<p>"Every one else knew that ages ago," replied the saucy
girl, laughing.</p>

<p>But she kissed both with a great amount of girlish
fervor, and to hide her emotion, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The carriages are waiting, and Sylvie is fuming with
impatience, so you had better bring your bride down-stairs,
Eliot."</p>

<p>They went down together, and when the spiteful Sylvie
saw the two handsome, happy faces, she was more vexed
than if Una had indeed been covered with diamonds, as
she had spitefully said. She could not help seeing that a
reconciliation had taken place between the two, and felt
instinctively that her cruel revelation to Una had precipitated
the understanding it was intended to avert.</p>

<p>But she could not avoid one poisoned shaft of malice at
the happy girl, and so, with a sneer, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Dear me! Una still posing as a bride at this late day?
Your wedding-day must have been a very happy one, since
you love to recall it so well."</p>

<p>No one replied to the impertinent speech, for all, even
Bryant, understood its spleen. Una only shrunk closer to
her husband, and they went out to the carriages that were
waiting to convey them to the theater.</p>

<p>Two boxes had been taken for the evening, and there
were twelve in the party, including the two ladies and
three gentlemen that Sylvie had invited. Una was very
glad that Sylvie and Ida did not come into the same box
with herself and Eliot. Their cold, sneering looks made
her shiver and feel unhappy, so she was glad when she
found Maud and Edith with one other young lady and one
gentleman as the evening's companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>The house was full, and the curtain had risen on the
first act&mdash;a brilliant scene with a fine setting. Mme.
Leonie had not made her appearance yet, and the audience
felt at liberty to turn a good many curious lorgnettes upon
the handsome theater-party. Una, all in white, with her
waving golden hair, red lips, and large dark eyes, immediately
fixed attention. The murmur ran from lip to lip:</p>

<p>"A bride&mdash;a bride!"</p>

<p>Eliot saw what a sensation her beauty was creating, and
smiled in pride; but Una was too innocent to comprehend
the truth. In fact, she scarcely looked at the audience.
Her eager eyes intently watched the stage.</p>

<p>She was anxious to see the great actress of whom the
newspapers spoke in such lavish praise.</p>

<p>So, while the adoring young husband by her side kept
his fond eyes on her face, Una watched the stage, and her
eagerness was soon rewarded by a sight of Mme. Leonie.</p>

<p>Mme. Leonie was tall, beautiful, stately, and the black
velvet robe, starred with diamonds, in which she was
assaying a queenly rôle, became her well. Una gave a
little gasp of honest admiration.</p>

<p>Mme. Leonie's voice rose on the air clear, sweet, shrill,
and Eliot Van Zandt turned with a quick start toward the
stage.</p>

<p>At the same moment, he became aware that Una's little
hand had clutched tightly, spasmodically around his arm.</p>

<p>He looked into her face. Its usual pure, creamy pallor
had deepened to ashy whiteness, her dark eyes were wild
and frightened.</p>

<p>"Una!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Eliot, look!" she whispered, tremblingly. "It
is she&mdash;Madame Lorraine!"</p>

<p>He turned his eyes to the stage, from which, a moment
ago, that voice had given him such a start.</p>

<p>Yes, Una was right. There she stood&mdash;the beautiful,
cruel woman who had doomed him to such an awful fate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
who had made Una's life so bitter, whose malice and spite
had been so supremely fiendish&mdash;Mme. Lorraine!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>Every eye was turned to the stage, and tumultuous applause
greeted the appearance of the favorite, so no one
noticed the agitation of the young husband and wife who,
tightly clasping each other's hands, stared with loathing
eyes at the beautiful actress.</p>

<p>It seemed to both an evil omen&mdash;this meeting with cruel,
heartless Mme. Lorraine in the first hour of their supreme
happiness after the months of doubt and reserve that had
held them apart.</p>

<p>All unconscious of the eyes that watched her&mdash;the eyes
she believed closed forever in the sleep of death, the clever
actress went on with her part, and, shrinking closer to
Eliot's side, Una whispered with a strange, foreboding
fear:</p>

<p>"Let us go home before she sees us. Do not let her
find out that we are still living."</p>

<p>Man-like, he smiled at her terror, and whispered back:</p>

<p>"My darling, we have nothing to fear from Madame
Lorraine's hatred now. Can you not trust to your husband
to protect you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;oh, yes," the girl-wife murmured; but the chill
foreboding of evil did not leave her mind, and she shrunk
back into the shadow of the heavy box-curtain, praying in
her heart that Mme. Lorraine's hateful glance might not
find her out.</p>

<p>Perhaps it might not have done so, for, to madame's
credit be it said, she did not ogle the boxes after the manner
of some actresses. She was intent on her part, and,
beyond the knowledge that she had a large and fashionable
audience, she took no particular interest in the throng of
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>But a perverse spirit had entered into Eliot Van Zandt,
and seeing the woman so cool, calm, and heartless, he
longed to let her know that her vengeance failed of its aim
and her victims escaped her. He pictured to himself her
jealous, impotent fury when she should know that both he
and her Little Nobody lived, and that they were happily
married and beyond the reach of her venom.</p>

<p>And in that last belief he made his great mistake.</p>

<p>He whispered his thoughts to Una. In truth, he was
longing to take his exquisite vengeance on his enemy.</p>

<p>Una forced a smile of meek acquiescence. She said to
herself that she could not let her splendid young husband
know what a little coward she was, and how she feared her
old tyrant and enemy.</p>

<p>At the close of the third act Eliot said, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Will you let me have your bouquet, Una? To-morrow
I will bring you a sweeter one."</p>

<p>With secret reluctance she let him have it. He wrote
hurriedly a few words on a card and attached it to the
flowers.</p>

<p>Una looked over his shoulder. She read:</p>

<p>"Compliments of Eliot Van Zandt and his bride, the
'Little Nobody.'"</p>

<p>"Oh!" the girl cried, with a shiver; but Eliot had
already thrown it upon the stage at the feet of the tragedy
queen, who was bowing and smiling in response to an enthusiastic
recall.</p>

<p>Among a dozen floral tributes she saw that pure, white,
bride-like one flung from the opera-box. She took it up,
lifted it to her lips, and bowed, then scanned the name
written on the card, while Eliot watched her with a triumphant
smile, Una with nameless fear.</p>

<p>Eliot was quite curious to note what effect that startling
card would have upon the wicked actress. It seemed to
him that she would be stunned, that she would fall to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
floor in abject terror, crying out for mercy from him she
had wronged.</p>

<p>Una, too, expected every instant that she would fall
down unconscious, overcome by fear and anger.</p>

<p>Neither one comprehended the stoicism, the incomparable
will-power of the gifted, wicked French woman.</p>

<p>Terrible and overwhelming as was the knowledge thus
suddenly acquired, Mme. Lorraine neither by word nor sign
gave any evidence that she had received a shock. She
merely stood still&mdash;very still&mdash;for a minute or so with her
eyes riveted upon the card, and the audience, suspecting
nothing of this strange by-play, received the impression
that the writing on the card was rather illegible, hence the
slowness of the actress in deciphering the name.</p>

<p>At last, with an inward shudder, madame lifted her eyes
from the bit of pasteboard upon which she had been gazing
as one looks at a serpent hidden among flowers. Her
glance went straight to the box where Eliot and Una, so
beautiful, so happy, in their youth and love, sat with
bated breath watching her face. She recognized them
instantly; a subtle smile dawned on her face, she bowed
profoundly.</p>

<p>The audience, still unconscious of the truth, applauded
madame's graceful courtesy to the echo, and kissing the
tips of her fingers, smiling right and left, she retired.</p>

<p>Una drew a long, sobbing breath of relief as the beautiful
woman vanished from sight. Eliot smiled and whispered:</p>

<p>"She accepts her defeat with equanimity. Her self-command
is admirable, enviable."</p>

<p>"I am so glad she took it so coolly; I dare say she
does not care," Una murmured, gladly, and some of the
stifling fear and dread left her heart.</p>

<p>If she could have looked behind the scenes into madame's
dressing-room, she would not have felt so confident.</p>

<p>Mima had to exert all her skill to bring her mistress up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
to the mark to enable her to go on with the fourth and
last act in the play.</p>

<p>Her agitation upon reaching the dressing-room had been
great, and Mima for a moment had been scarcely less
shaken; but her nerves were very strong, and she soon began
to reassure Mme. Lorraine.</p>

<p>"It is nothing&mdash;pshaw! Do not let your mind be upset,
madame. Be glad that the fair-faced lad lives. Your
conscience is that much lighter, and for the rest, he was
never worthy the passion of so magnificent a woman!"</p>

<p>"He was the only man I ever loved!" madame cried,
obstinately. "He was splendid, whatever you say, Mima,
and to think that she, the Little Nobody, has come back
from the very grave to part us, to win him from me! Oh,
it is bitter! I will not endure it. He was mad to fling that
defiance in my face. I will make him pay dearly, dearly
for that insolence!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You shall not get yourself into any more
scrapes over that boy!" Mima cried, angrily.</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>"You shall see," she said. "I will come between
them; I will part them. I swear it!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Mima said again. "You do not even
know where they live."</p>

<p>"I shall find out!" the actress cried, obstinately; and
then she gave vent to a sudden cry of shrill delight.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!"</p>

<p>"What is it, then?" curtly.</p>

<p>"Fortune favors me. You know I am invited to a
little <i>petit souper</i> to-night after the theater. It is at the
house of one of the Boston <i>bon ton</i>, and the name on the
card is 'Mrs. Bryant Van Zandt.'"</p>

<p>Even the imperturbable Mima started with surprise.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>Madame laughed, and the laugh was not good to hear.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt they are relatives of my Yankee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
friend," she said. "Perhaps, even they live in the same
house. I shall be sure to go, and then&mdash;<i>che sarâ, sarâ</i>!"
Her voice had a fiendish threat in its angry cadence.</p>

<p>She went back on the stage, smiling, insolent. She
looked once or twice into the box from whence the white
flowers had been thrown to her, and smiled whenever she
looked. And Una's blood ran cold whenever she met that
smile. She instinctively felt that it was one of menace.</p>

<p>She was very, very glad when it was all over, and she
could nestle by Eliot's side in the carriage with her cold
little hand in his.</p>

<p>Maud and Edith rode with them, but they did not utter
one word to even hint to them that Mme. Leonie, the
actress, was Mme. Lorraine, the wicked woman who had
been so cruel to them in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Both said to themselves that it did not matter now.
Let her enjoy her fame, if she could, since out of her cruel
plans had come their wedded happiness.</p>

<p>She would leave Boston to-morrow for Philadelphia,
where she was to play next, and in all likelihood her path
would never cross theirs again.</p>

<p>So, dismissing the wicked woman from their minds, Eliot
and Una waited with the girls in the drawing-room for the
coming of the rest of the party who were a little late.</p>

<p>At last there was a bustle, a murmur of voices and
laughter in the hall&mdash;then entered Sylvie, Ida, and their
guests&mdash;lastly Bryant Van Zandt, on his arm&mdash;Mme.
Leonie!</p>

<p>"Ah, girls! ah, Eliot!" Sylvie cried out, in pretty triumph.
"See what a charming surprise I have brought
you. Madame Leonie will honor us by taking supper
under our roof."</p>

<p>Not a tremor on the part of the actress betrayed the fact
that she had ever seen before the two to whom she bowed
with stately grace. For them, they were too amazed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
her matchless impudence to even remind her of the past,
and bowed coldly in acknowledgment of the introduction.</p>

<p>Turning away with Sylvie, they heard her say, in clear,
full tones:</p>

<p>"Ah, Madame Van Zandt, what an aristocratic-looking
young beauty is Mrs. Eliot Van Zandt! She is no doubt
of one of the finest old families of Boston."</p>

<p>Sylvie's cruel voice answered maliciously:</p>

<p>"On the contrary, a little nobody that Eliot picked up
somewhere on a Southern tour."</p>

<p>The eyes of the young husband and wife met, his indignant,
hers wet with tears.</p>

<p>"After all, it is true, I am a little nobody," she said,
faintly. "Oh, Eliot," with sudden animation, "what if
we should force Madame Lorraine to tell us the truth to-night&mdash;to
own frankly who and what I am?"</p>

<p>"You are Una Marie Van Zandt, and my wife. The
past need not matter, my darling," he replied, tenderly.</p>

<p>But the idea had taken complete possession of Una.</p>

<p>"Eliot, it maddens me to hear your brother's wife
always flinging that slur upon me&mdash;a little nobody! Let
us force Madame Lorraine to tell the truth to-night. She
is in your power, for although her conspiracy against your
life failed, she is amenable to the law for the wicked attempt.
Let us seek a private interview with her, Eliot.
Let us threaten her, frighten her into the confession of my
origin, however humble," pleaded Una, with impassioned
fervor.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Mme. Lorraine wormed Una's story out of Mrs. Van
Zandt with the greatest ease, Sylvie's spite making it an
actual labor of love to place her sister-in-law in the worst
possible light before the great actress who had deigned to
express admiration for her beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>In a little while the wicked woman knew that which
thrilled her with cruel joy&mdash;that beautiful Una, living in
the same house with Eliot and bearing his name, had never
been aught to him but his wife in name only.</p>

<p>"He never loved her, and would be glad if he had never
seen her," Sylvie said, lying unblushingly in her hatred of
Una.</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine condoled with her in politest phrases,
hiding her exultation under an appearance of calmness.
She said to herself:</p>

<p>"His wife in name only! It is not so bad as I thought.
It will be easy to part them now."</p>

<p>Her opportunity soon came without an effort of her own,
through Una's eagerness to find out the secret of her
origin.</p>

<p>Eliot had consented to Una's wish, and immediately
after the elegant supper, which had been provided by the
best caterer in Boston at Sylvie's expense, he sought an
opportunity to speak to her alone.</p>

<p>"Will Madame Leonie permit me the pleasure of showing
her through our little conservatory? We have a rare
plant in bloom there&mdash;a night-blooming cereus," he said.</p>

<p>Madame protested she would be delighted; slipped her
jeweled hand through his arm, and glided from the drawing-room
by his side.</p>

<p>The night-blooming cereus was not a feint. It was
really there, but so also was Una standing by its side, pale
and agitated, yet withal so lovely, that madame said to
herself, with something like contempt for her companion:</p>

<p>"He must be cold-hearted, indeed, to withhold love
from one so beautiful."</p>

<p>Eliot began abruptly:</p>

<p>"Madame Lorraine, of course you know we recognized
you immediately to-night?"</p>

<p>The beautiful actress bowed mockingly.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>He continued gravely:</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps you can guess why I have brought you
here?"</p>

<p>Glancing maliciously from the pale, grave face of Eliot
to the agitated one of his wife, madame said, scoffingly:</p>

<p>"To congratulate you and your bride on your happiness,
no doubt, monsieur!"</p>

<p>"No; nor to reproach you with your wickedness," Eliot
answered, sternly, his handsome face pale and set, his
splendid eyes full of scorn. "I brought you here,
madame, to say that in return for my leniency in not denouncing
you to the law for your attempt upon my life, I
demand at your hands one simple act of justice."</p>

<p>"Justice!" she echoed, vaguely.</p>

<p>"Yes, to me," said Una, drawing nearer. "Oh,
Madame Lorraine, the time is come at last when you must
tell me who and what I am. You have denied to me even
a name, but however poor and obscure my origin, I surely
have a right to some name, and I can no longer bear Mrs.
Van Zandt's sneers at the mystery that infolds me. Speak,
madame, and dissipate the cloud that veils the past."</p>

<p>"Speak!" Eliot echoed, sternly.</p>

<p>Then there was a moment of terrible suspense and
silence.</p>

<p>Madame had drawn back hurriedly from the two with
an expression of alarm and trouble on her mobile white
face. At last:</p>

<p>"Oh, you know not what you ask!" she faltered, with
emotion.</p>

<p>Growing ashen pale, Una cried out hoarsely:</p>

<p>"I am ready to hear&mdash;even the worst."</p>

<p>Eliot came to her side and drew her cold hand gently
through his arm.</p>

<p>"Do not look so frightened, Una, my love," he said,
gently. "If madame speaks the truth, she will say you
are well-born and of noble parentage."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame gave him a look of fierce wrath and scorn.</p>

<p>"Are you so sure?" she sneered. "Better let me go,
then, with your fatal question unanswered, and hug that
vain delusion to your breast."</p>

<p>Eliot answered dauntlessly:</p>

<p>"Most willingly, only for Una's sake. She has some
natural curiosity on the subject, and I have promised her
it shall be gratified."</p>

<p>The beautiful face of Mme. Lorraine grew positively
fiendish with the evil smile that flashed across it.</p>

<p>"A true daughter of Eve," she said; "but your Una,
as you call her, if she persists in her curiosity, may purchase
her knowledge at as bitter cost as did the adventurous
lady of Eden."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of the truth, if you will only speak it
and have done, madame," Una cried out, impatiently;
and Eliot felt her tremble violently as she leaned against
him.</p>

<p>Then both looked at the clever actress in surprise.</p>

<p>Her face had changed its expression, as if by magic, from
hate and scorn to softness, gentleness, and poignant regret.
Her splendid orbs were dim as with a mist of tears. Clasping
her jeweled hands together in strong agitation, she
faltered, pleadingly:</p>

<p>"Do not press me so hard, for&mdash;oh, how can I tell you
what you ask?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that there is shame, disgrace, linked
with&mdash;my birth&mdash;my parentage?" Una demanded, almost
wildly.</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine gave her a cunning upward glance full
of a sort of contemptuous pity.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, both of you," she said; "I have
wronged you both, but Heaven knows how I repent of my
evil deeds. I do not want to cause any more sorrow to
either of you, as I must do if I tell Una what she asks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Therefore, let me go away, in silence, and be sure that in
her case ignorance is bliss."</p>

<p>"I will not believe you, Madame Lorraine, if you assert
that aught of shame belongs to the parentage of my wife,"
Eliot said, hotly, and she uttered a long, long sigh.</p>

<p>"Whatever it is, I have a right to some name, however
humble," Una said; but Mme. Lorraine preserved a silence
that was significant.</p>

<p>Eliot drew his arm tenderly about Una's waist, as he
said:</p>

<p>"Dearest, you have a right to one of the proudest names
in Boston. Why trouble your little head about the past?"</p>

<p>But Una was obstinate. Sylvie's sneers had made her
bitter and determined.</p>

<p>She looked with dark, impatient eyes into the face of
the woman who hated her with relentless hate.</p>

<p>"Speak, madame," she said, icily. "Do you not see
that you must reveal the secret now, whatever it be, that
has thrown its stigma over my life?"</p>

<p>"I am in your power, monsieur; you can denounce me
for my attempted crime, if I refuse to answer you,"
madame said, looking at Eliot. "Do you still insist?"</p>

<p>He looked at Una; she murmured "Yes" through
pale, determined lips, but she did not see the covert triumph
in the eyes of her foe.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said the actress, with a heavy sigh.
She looked at Eliot with grave eyes. "Monsieur Van
Zandt, I must make at least one condition," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"It is this: you will leave me alone with your wife while
I reveal to her her name and true identity. It will be best
thus. The secret will then be her own, and it will be
optional with her whether she should reveal it to you or
not."</p>

<p>He bowed affirmatively.</p>

<p>"I have no objection to your plan, madame, and small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
curiosity over your secret. Whatever you may reveal to
Una, it will in nowise lessen my regard for my wife."</p>

<p>He went out and left them together.</p>

<p>Mme. Lorraine turned her vindictive eyes upon Una
hissing fiercely:</p>

<p>"Do you not know that you are very foolish in this
matter? Would I have treated you as I did for fifteen
years, if you had not been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Una, impatiently, as she paused significantly,
and regarded her with angry, scornful eyes.</p>

<p>Bending forward until her writhing lips almost touched
the small, pink ear of the girl, Mme. Lorraine finished her
broken sentence in a hissing voice like that of a serpent.</p>

<p>It was as if Mme. Lorraine had struck the girl upon the
face. She reeled backward with a low, gasping, terrified
cry, and sunk to the floor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eliot waited almost an hour in the drawing-room for
madame to return, and Mrs. Van Zandt grew angry and
impatient at the detention of her guest by that Little Nobody.
Eliot made all the excuses he could. They were
talking about the flowers; Mme. Leonie loved them so
dearly, etc. At last he went in search of the two.</p>

<p>Madame was just emerging from the conservatory with
a smile of triumph on her handsome face.</p>

<p>As he would have passed her, she detained him with a
hand laid heavily on his arm.</p>

<p>"Do not go to her yet. She desired me to keep you
away from her a little while until she can collect her
thoughts and decide whether it is best to share her terrible
secret with you or not."</p>

<p>"But surely she needs me now," he said, quailing at
the words. "Her terrible secret!"</p>

<p>"She prefers to be alone, she said," madame returned,
so positively that he decided, against his sense of duty, to
humor Una's whim. He guessed it was not a pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
revelation madame had made among the warm, sweet odors
of the dim conservatory.</p>

<p>The actress returned to the drawing-room, made her
adieus, and departed. Then the rest of the party broke
up, and the family retired to their several apartments.
Eliot went to the conservatory for Una.</p>

<p>"I can not leave her alone any longer in her trouble,
poor child!" he thought, with a heart full of tenderness.</p>

<p>To his surprise, the flowery retreat was quite deserted.</p>

<p>"She has stepped out unperceived in the confusion of
the leave-takings, and gone to her room," he decided, and
a yearning impulse led him to seek her there.</p>

<p>He knocked at first softly on the door, and receiving no
reply, entered quietly, feeling that she needed him in the
distress she was enduring over madame's revelation.</p>

<p>But the room, like the conservatory, was deserted.</p>

<p>Over the dressing-table the gas was burning brightly.
Eliot's eyes quickly detected an envelope lying just beneath
the light that bore in large characters his own name.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h2>


<p>He stood staring with frightened eyes at the white envelope,
with its large black letters formed in Una's crude
handwriting, dreading to touch it, for a swift instinct told
him the truth.</p>

<p>She had left him, he felt quite sure&mdash;left him almost in
the very hour when the discovery of their mutual love for
each other had paved the way to their wedded happiness.
Mme. Lorraine, like the serpent crawling into Eden, had
brought woe and pain where love and joy had reigned.</p>

<p>All this flashed over him instinctively as he took the
letter in his hand and tore it open, devouring in fierce
haste the brief, sad note Una had written such a little
while ago that the ink was scarcely dry upon the page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is my farewell to you, Eliot," it said. "I have
learned the secret of my identity. Forgive me that I
shrink from revealing it to you. I can only say that it
comes between us, and divides us as effectually as the grave
itself. I have left you forever. Do not seek to trace me,
for nothing can ever induce me to live with you again.
Give up the thought of me and obtain a divorce (it will be
easy, for, thank Heaven, I have never been your wife, save
in name only), then you can marry Ida Hayes, whom you
loved before you ever saw me. God bless you for all your
goodness to me. If you had known who I was that time
in New Orleans, you need not have sacrificed yourself for
my sake. God bless my&mdash;yes, I will presume to call them
sisters this once&mdash;Maud and Edith! I have left them the
jewels they wore to-night in memory of Una, to whom
they were so kind. Forget me, Eliot, as soon as you can,
for I am all unworthy of your name and your love.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Little Nobody.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She had deliberately signed the name she hated so much,
and he knew that her humility must have been great to
drive her to such an act. With a groan he sunk into a
chair and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>"How could she, with her beauty and innocence, her
high-bred air and noble soul, be lowly, even shamefully
born, as this letter would have me believe?" he exclaimed.
"No, no; it is only another of that wicked woman's falsehoods.
She has taken Una with her, out of hatred for
my darling and envy of our happiness. There can be
nothing strong enough to come between us, my little love
and I. Oh, why did I leave them alone together? I
might have known that serpent's wiles. But I will follow
and bring them back! Fortunately it is not too late."</p>

<p>But he was mistaken, for when he reached madame's
hotel, half an hour later, he was told that she had left
Boston by the 1:30 train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just thirty minutes too late!" he muttered, wildly,
and the sleepy night-clerk of the hotel looked at him in
contemptuous amazement. He thought he must be some
demented admirer of Mme. Leonie.</p>

<p>Eliot knew that madame's next engagement was in
Philadelphia, and he determined that he would follow by
the next train.</p>

<p>"Will she have the temerity to take Una with her, or
will she try to hide her from me? The latter, most likely,"
he thought, sadly, and a presentiment grew upon him
that his lovely girl-wife was lost to him forever.</p>

<p>But he followed the actress by the next train to Philadelphia,
only to learn that she had never arrived there.
At a heavy cost, she had made her manager cancel her engagement,
and neither herself nor the manager could be
found there, nor a clew obtained to their whereabouts.</p>

<p>Just as suddenly as she had returned to the stage, she
disappeared from it, and the mystery of her disappearance
was the topic of newspaper paragraphs for some days.</p>

<p>Only one of the journalistic fraternity had any idea of
the cause of her flight, and he was too proud and bitter to
give it to the world.</p>

<p>To his own family, under strict bonds of secrecy, he
confided the truth, and Maud and Edith were indignant at
the thought that wicked Mme. Lorraine had dared come
beneath their roof, and loud in their protestations of disbelief
in the story that there was a stain on Una's birth.</p>

<p>But Bryant, Sylvie, and Ida preserved a significant
silence that told more plainly than words their belief that
all had happened for the best. They hoped secretly that
Eliot would get a divorce, as Una had told him to do.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.</a></h2>


<p>After the space of five years, let us look in again upon
the Van Zandts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Eliot Van Zandt has a guest.</p>

<p>Pierre Carmontelle!</p>

<p>For five years the noble Louisianian has been a wanderer
in foreign lands. He has returned at last cured of his
passion for the girl he had loved, strong enough now to
witness her happiness with another.</p>

<p>Not since the day when he bid farewell to Eliot and his
bride has he heard aught of their fate until now, when,
strong in the consciousness of his conquered love, he goes
to Boston, determined to visit the happy pair before his
return South.</p>

<p>"I shall see Van Zandt grown portly and important,
the Little Nobody of old matronly and magnificent," he
said to himself, with a smile.</p>

<p>Fancy the shock of the reality when he found Eliot a
grave, sad man, old beyond his years through the influence
of sorrow for the young wife lost so strangely out of his
life.</p>

<p>It was several minutes after Eliot had told him his story
before he could utter a word, so greatly was he affected by
what had been told him. Then he called down the vengeance
of Heaven on the head of the wicked woman.</p>

<p>Eliot's grave, sad face, with its lines of suffering, told
plainer than words all that he had endured.</p>

<p>"Surely you pursued them?" cried Carmontelle.</p>

<p>"As long as my means lasted&mdash;yes," said Van Zandt.
"But that was such a little while. You know I had so
little beyond my salary, and&mdash;there were my two sisters."</p>

<p>"You should have written to me."</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;your letter was returned to me&mdash;you had sailed
for Europe."</p>

<p>"And not a clew in all these years?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"I need not ask if you have taken Una's advice and
procured a divorce?" Carmontelle said, with quiet comprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of the other's pale, grave face that flushed
slightly, as he answered:</p>

<p>"I am bound to Una while I live, although I have given
up all hope of ever seeing her again."</p>

<p>Carmontelle's steady eyes went over the worn sheet of
paper on which Una had traced her pathetic farewell to
her husband.</p>

<p>"And Miss Hayes, whom she says here you loved before
your marriage?" he said, abruptly.</p>

<p>"I can not tell how she fell into such an error. Miss
Hayes is my brother's sister-in-law. She visited here
often, but we were never more than friends," Eliot answered,
quietly, all unsuspicious of Sylvie's treachery.</p>

<p>Then the ladies of the house came in, and the conversation
drifted to other subjects.</p>

<p>Sylvie was the same exquisitely dressed doll; but five
years had changed Maud and Edith from pretty, vivacious
girls to quiet, dignified young ladies. In Maud there was a
greater change than in Edith, and the secret lay in the
failure of her beloved novel.</p>

<p>Three years ago the cherished book had been given to
the world, and the cruel critics had ridiculed the immature
work of the girl, saying that the wild flights of fancy, so
fresh, so buoyant, could have emanated from none but a
young, inexperienced brain knowing nothing of the hard,
cruel world.</p>

<p>Pretty, tender Maud did not have the spirit of a Byron
to retort on her critics and write, despite their sneers, so
she laid down her pen, as she said, forever, and nearly
broke her heart in bitter humiliation over her cruel failure.
So there lay the secret of the beauty so ethereally frail that
one fancied, in looking at her, that the spirit would soon
plume its wings for another world.</p>

<p>Edith was made of different metal. When the picture
on which she had spent so much time was voted as great a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
failure as Maud's book, she shed a few bitter tears,
brushed them away, and began again.</p>

<p>On her easel had stood, for some time, an unfinished
portrait of Una. Turning to this now, she made a fancy
picture of it, and boldly called it Una.</p>

<p>Upon this portrait rested Edith's fame. When exhibited,
it created a great sensation. She had many offers for
it, but she rejected all to present the portrait to her
brother. He was deeply moved, and declared that the
gift of a fortune would not have pleased him so much.</p>

<p>So Edith's fame was established. A few copies of the
beautiful "Una" found ready sale. Then there came in
orders for portraits. She had her own beautiful studio
now, and made money enough to buy her own dresses, and
Maud's, too; so Eliot was free now, but he had never begrudged
the manly aid he lent to his sisters. Even now
he spent very little for himself, but went on laying up his
small savings carefully for Una, if she should ever come
back.</p>

<p>Pierre Carmontelle, who had traveled five years to get
cured of an attack of the <i>grande passion</i>, fell straight into
Cupid's net again when he encountered Maud's pensive
beauty. She, on her part, was attracted to this noble man
of forty-odd years as she had never been to younger ones
who had bowed at her shrine.</p>

<p>Never did anything come about more suddenly; for the
Southerner, who had expected to remain in Boston only a
day, stayed a month, and at the expiration of that time
Maud was his promised wife.</p>

<p>Of course they had talked to each other about Una, and
when Maud wanted to defer the bridal-day six months,
Carmontelle said, artfully:</p>

<p>"Do not make it so long as that, my darling, because
you and I want to go in search of Una just as soon as we
are married, do we not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she answered eagerly; and thereupon agreed to
get ready to be married in two months.</p>

<p>Sylvie said that it was all hurried up in the worst of
taste. She had not believed Maud would be so ready to
snap up a rich man; but&mdash;ah! well, your romantic, novel-writing
folks had an eye to the main chance, like everybody
else.</p>

<p>Edith answered daringly:</p>

<p>"Why not say at once, Sylvie, that you're envious because
Maud is going to be as rich as you are? Goodness
knows, I'm glad one of the Van Zandts will be rich at last,
so that you will not be able always to fling our poverty in
our faces!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h2>


<p>Maud declared that the trousseau must be a very simple
and quiet one, since almost everything must come from
the pockets of Eliot and Edith.</p>

<p>But the brother and sister overruled her objections.</p>

<p>"As if we had any other use for our savings!" cried
Edith. "We are going to spend every penny. Do you
think we are going to let our sister go to her rich husband
plain and shabby?"</p>

<p>So the order was given for several very handsome
dresses, among them an ivory white satin, veiled in lace,
for the bridal-dress.</p>

<p>But before the bills came in from milliners and modistes
the young authoress was able to pay them out of her own
purse.</p>

<p>And it came about in this wise.</p>

<p>About four weeks after her engagement to the rich
Southerner she received a visit from her Boston publisher.</p>

<p>He put into her hand a check for several hundred
dollars, the receipts from her novel which until now had
not paid for the first costs of its publication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Miss Van Zandt," he said.
"Your novel is suddenly becoming popular. The book-sellers
report numerous calls for it, and in consequence I
have large orders."</p>

<p>Maud's lip quivered, and her blue-gray eyes, so like
Eliot's, dimmed with happy tears.</p>

<p>"At last!" she exclaimed, joyously. "Oh, I had
ceased to hope or expect anything!"</p>

<p>"I have taken pains to inquire into the cause of your
success after the unfriendliness of the critics had so long
injured its sale," he said; "and I have found out that the
real merits of your novel have at last been discovered and
revealed by a friendly critic."</p>

<p>"I thought they were all my mortal foes!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He smiled, and answered:</p>

<p>"Not this one, at least, for he or she has been very
frank, as well as very just. While the defects of your
book are plainly acknowledged, its many beauties and
merits are enthusiastically dwelt upon, and the fact of the
author's tender youth is eloquently dilated on in excusing
its faults."</p>

<p>The girl's sweet eyes dilated wildly.</p>

<p>"Who could have known that?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"I can not tell. I understood that the writer is a reviewer
of books for a noted New York magazine. I have
not learned the name, but I will find it out for you, Miss
Van Zandt," promised the genial publisher.</p>

<p>"Pray, do so, if possible; and also please get the magazine
containing the friendly review of my poor book. It
will make me so happy to read it, and to write a letter of
thanks to my good angel!" she exclaimed, fervently.</p>

<p>Smiling at her enthusiasm, and promising to gratify her
desire, the publisher took leave, and the very next day
sent her the magazine.</p>

<p>How gladly, how happily the young heart beat as her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
eager eyes devoured the column of reviews, and at last fell
on "The Fatal Roses," her own romantic and high-flown
novel, over whose non-success she had shed such bitter,
burning tears.</p>

<p>But they were tears of joy that glittered on her lashes
now, as she went eagerly over the two full columns that
had been given to "The Fatal Roses" by one who signed
the, to Maud, startling name of "Una."</p>

<p>"Una!" she cried out, wildly, and ran to seek Eliot,
who was in the library with her intended husband.</p>

<p>"Eliot! oh, Eliot, look! Our own darling Una!" she
exclaimed, wildly, pointing with her taper finger at the
startling name.</p>

<p>Scarcely less agitated than herself, he took the review
and read it hurriedly, then passed it to Carmontelle.</p>

<p>"Can it be my Una?" he exclaimed, pale and agitated,
his heart beating wildly.</p>

<p>But the face of Pierre Carmontelle looked calm and
grave.</p>

<p>"Dear Eliot, dear Maud, do not give yourself up too
ardently to hope," he said. "This may prove but a coincidence.
The name may have been chosen as a <i>nom de
plume</i> by the writer."</p>

<p>"My publisher promised to find out the name of the
critic, if possible," Maud said; and to him Eliot went at
once in a fever of anxiety.</p>

<p>Mr. Dudley could not give him any satisfaction. He
had written to the New York publisher, asking for information,
but had not yet received his reply. As soon as
it came, he would be happy to lay his letter before Miss
Van Zandt and her brother.</p>

<p>It was almost a week before the reply came, and Mr.
Dudley forwarded it at once to Maud.</p>

<p>The New York publisher wrote that he was unacquainted
with his able critic, save by the name of Una. All his
business with her was transacted through a Boston banker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
whose name he gave, and whom the Van Zandts knew as
the head of one of the most influential banks in the city.</p>

<p>"She is here, then, in this very city, my lost Una&mdash;so
near and 'yet so far!'" groaned Eliot. "But I shall go
at once to Mr. Chesterton, with whom I have long had a
friendly acquaintance."</p>

<p>He went and elicited simply nothing. The great banker
would give him no information.</p>

<p>"I am not at liberty to speak one word on the subject,
although I would gladly oblige you, Van Zandt, were it in
my power!" he cried, affably.</p>

<p>"At least tell me if Una is young, and if it is a real
name, or a <i>nom de plume</i>," pleaded Eliot.</p>

<p>"I regret that I am not at liberty to answer your questions,"
repeated courteous Mr. Chesterton.</p>

<p>Baffled, but almost convinced by all this mystery that
Maud's friendly critic was none other than his lovely, lost
Una, Eliot went away in despair, and found a comforter
in Carmontelle.</p>

<p>"Leave it to me, Eliot, and I will find out all about
the little runaway," he said, confidently.</p>

<p>He went to a directory and found out the residence of
Mr. Chesterton, a stately brown-stone residence in a fashionable
and aristocratic street.</p>

<p>A day or two later he said to Van Zandt:</p>

<p>"I have found out all about the members of Mr. Chesterton's
family. He has a handsome young wife, three
small children, and a beautiful young governess."</p>

<p>"Una!" Eliot cried, with a start.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but we must not be too sure. I have not
seen her yet," said Carmontelle.</p>

<p>"But you will do so soon?" anxiously.</p>

<p>A week later he came to Eliot where he sat with his sisters
in the library, their favorite room, for here Sylvie seldom
obtruded her presence.</p>

<p>Maud, so lovely and happy now that she did not look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
like the pensive girl of a month ago, sprung up impetuously
and caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, you look so happy, you surely found our darling
girl!"</p>

<p>Taking Eliot's and Edith's indulgence for granted, he
pressed a light kiss on her pure brow.</p>

<p>"You have guessed aright," he answered, "I have seen
Mr. Chesterton's governess. She calls herself Mademoiselle
Lorraine, and teaches French to the little Chestertons,
but she is indeed no other than our Una."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" Eliot cried, springing up, "I will
go to her at once."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! She will not receive you," said his friend,
and Eliot flung himself down again with a groan.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Pierre Carmontelle, "Mademoiselle
Lorraine goes out every afternoon to walk with her little
charges. She is always closely veiled, and sometimes she
walks past this very house, and looks up at the windows
with eyes full of sadness. I saw her myself to-day, and
recognized her in spite of her thick veil. I followed her,
and when near the gate, I spoke to her; but afterward I
was almost sorry I had done so, she was so terribly frightened."</p>

<p>"Frightened!&mdash;but why?" cried Maud.</p>

<p>And Eliot echoed bitterly:</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I can not tell you, I only know that she did not accord
me any welcome. She only looked sorry and frightened
and cried out sharply: 'Oh, you have hunted me down!
This is cruel, cruel; but, oh, Monsieur Carmontelle, for
God's sake, do not betray me to Eliot&mdash;to Mr. Van
Zandt.'"</p>

<p>"And then?" cried Edith, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Then her little pupils came around her and hurried
her inside the gate. She looked back at me, waved her
little gloved hand imploringly, and cried out again, 'Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
not betray me to Eliot, or any one.' Then she vanished
inside the banker's door."</p>

<p>They sat looking sadly, and yet gladly, at one another.
At least she lived, poor darling, and was out of the power
of the wicked woman whose malice had lured her from
home and love.</p>

<p>"If I could only see her, only speak to her, my poor
little Una, I am sure I could win her confidence!" Eliot
exclaimed, passionately.</p>

<p>"You are right; and indeed you must see her now,"
answered his friend. "Una must give you her confidence,
must come home to you. It is not right that she, your
wife, and my adopted child, should be slaving her young
life away like this through some fancied duty."</p>

<p>"I must see her. I will go to Mr. Chesterton since she
denies me a sight of her. I will tell him my story, I will
ask him to plead my cause with Una," Eliot exclaimed,
in strong agitation; and just a little later he stood before
the banker's mansion ringing the bell, and looking up in
the darkness at the front of the great house, thrilling with
the thought that his loved, lost bride was so near to him
at this moment, that it seemed almost impossible but that
they must soon come face to face.</p>

<p>"And if she loves me still, as she said she did that happy
night before she left me, I swear that no earthly power
shall ever tear her again from my arms!" he vowed to
himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Chesterton was at home, and received his guest in
the library with courteous surprise; but when the young
man poured forth his agitated story, the banker became
greatly interested and excited.</p>

<p>"You are right. She is, she must be your wife. She
came to us two years ago from the Convent of Le Bon
Berger in New Orleans. My wife was once a pupil there,
and wrote to the mother superior for a French teacher for
our little ones. She sent us Mademoiselle Lorraine, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
is as gifted and clever as she is lovely and winning. But
I have always seen that she lay beneath the shadow of
some sorrow. Wait, my young friend, and I will go upstairs
and beg this proud young wife to give you an immediate
interview," concluded the good man.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.</a></h2>


<p>Eliot waited in the large, elegant library with eager
impatience, never doubting that Mr. Chesterton would
succeed in his kindly mission. Una could not be so cruel
as to refuse him an interview.</p>

<p>"And once in her presence I will combat every objection
she can raise until I persuade her to go home with
me," he said to himself, firmly, and his heart began to
beat lightly, happily, with the thought that soon Una
would be with him, never to be torn from him again.</p>

<p>"It is five years since I saw her. She was scarcely more
than a child then. Now she is a woman, beautiful, gifted,
intelligent. Oh, how I long to be wealthy, for the sake
of my fair young wife!" he thought.</p>

<p>Then it dawned upon him that the banker was staying
a long time. The bronze clock on the mantel had chimed
the quarters of an hour twice while he had sat there all
alone.</p>

<p>"He finds her hard to persuade," he exclaimed, rising
from his chair and beginning to pace restlessly up and
down the floor.</p>

<p>Five, ten minutes elapsed. Then there came a step at
the door. The handle turned. Mr. Chesterton entered&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>Eliot turned to him in unutterable dismay.</p>

<p>"Una!" he exclaimed, hoarsely, then paused, speechless.
He saw a folded slip of paper in the banker's hand,
and on his genial face disappointment and regret.</p>

<p>"Van Zandt, I am sorry for you, upon my word!" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
said, feelingly. "I used all my eloquence, but I have
failed. She gave me this note for you," he added, thrusting
the slip of paper into Eliot's hand.</p>

<p>He took it in a dazed, lifeless way, opened it slowly, and
read the words written in an elegant flowing hand, very
different from the cramped, childish one in which Una had
penned her farewell to him five years ago.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Oh, forgive me," it ran, "but I can not see you now,
or ever again in this world. What I wrote you when I
left you five years ago remains unchanged. There is a
barrier between us cruel as the grave. You must seek
freedom from the nominal tie that binds you to me. Then
you will forget me and find happiness with some woman
more blessed by fate than I have been. For me, I shall
convince you that our separation is irrevocable by returning
at once to New Orleans, there to enter a convent and
take the veil for life.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Una.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The cruel letter fell from his hand, and staggering
heavily forward, Eliot dropped into a chair and bowed his
face on the table.</p>

<p>"Van Zandt!" exclaimed the banker.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>Rushing to Eliot's side, he lifted his head from the
table, and it fell again heavily. The young man's overwrought
feelings had culminated in momentary unconsciousness.</p>

<p>A sharp peal of the bell brought the servants rushing to
the scene, but not so soon but that Mr. Chesterton heard
a gasp of terror from behind the curtains that divided the
library from a pretty little parlor. Poor Una had crept
in there for one stolen glimpse of the face of her beloved.</p>

<p>The banker saw the lovely, frightened face peering
around the curtain, and said, sharply:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Van Zandt, I fear you have killed your husband!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>With a stifled wail, she rushed forward and flung herself
on her knees beside Eliot's unconscious form, catching his
limp hands in both her warm, trembling white ones.</p>

<p>"Dead! Oh, no, no, Mr. Chesterton, do not charge me
with such cruelty!" she cried, gazing with straining eyes
into that pale, handsome face. Her touch, her voice, her
gaze, seemed to recall him to life, for suddenly his eyes
opened wide on that lovely face. A cry of dismay broke
from her lips, and dropping his hands, she rushed through
the curtains and disappeared just as two servants entered
at the other door.</p>

<p>"Bring water and wine," said the banker. "This
gentleman is ill."</p>

<p>Both disappeared at once, and Eliot Van Zandt struggled
up to a sitting posture, gazing wildly around the room.</p>

<p>"Una&mdash;she was here!" he murmured, faintly.</p>

<p>"She has gone," Mr. Chesterton answered, gravely.
"Drink this wine, Van Zandt, it will revive you."</p>

<p>"No; the water, please."</p>

<p>He swallowed a few drops, and rose to go in spite of Mr.
Chesterton's entreaties that he would stay until he was
better.</p>

<p>"I am all right. It was but a temporary faintness.
Heaven bless you for your kindness to a miserable man,
Mr. Chesterton," said Eliot, wringing his friend's hand
fervently.</p>

<p>Then he repossessed himself of Una's note that he had
dropped on the floor, and went out of the room with a
ghastly face. Mr. Chesterton, alarmed at his looks, followed
him at a discreet distance until he saw him enter a
car that would take him straight to Beacon Hill, then bethinking
himself of an engagement he had for that evening,
he hurried back home to don evening-dress and escort
his beautiful wife to a soirée.</p>

<p>Returning home in the small hours, he concluded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
make a confidante of his wife and enlist her sympathies
in Eliot Van Zandt's case.</p>

<p>"What a romantic story!" exclaimed Mrs. Chesterton.
"But I always thought there was something very interesting
hidden in the past of our gifted governess. So she is
a Van Zandt&mdash;one of the oldest, proudest names in Boston.
My dear, I will speak to her in the morning, and see if I
can not untangle the strange web of fate that has been
woven around her life by that wicked Madame Lorraine."</p>

<p>"I knew your sympathies would be drawn to this unhappy
pair, Constance!" exclaimed the banker, fondly.</p>

<p>But, alas! his story had been told too late. Morning
found the young governess gone.</p>

<p>She had left the house during their absence, and taken
her trunks with her, flying like a thief in the night, not
from pursuit, not from shame, but from a husband's love,
the deepest, fondest, most passionate that ever thrilled a
manly breast.</p>

<p>"I must take the veil, then he will understand that all
hope is indeed ended," she said, resolutely to herself. "I
had no business returning here. Father Quentin told me
it was wrong, but in my mad yearning to see his face, I
would not listen. Now I must go back and stay there
forever. Eliot will soon forget me, for it was more pity
than love that he felt for me. When he realizes that all
is irrevocably at an end between us, he will seek his freedom
that he may return to his old love, his first love, Ida
Hayes."</p>

<p>With the thought of her rival, all the old-time bitter
jealousy rushed over Una's heart, and she told herself that
Eliot had never really loved any one but Ida, and that he
could not but rejoice some day that fate had freed him
from the incubus of Little Nobody.</p>

<p>"I have spoiled his life for years, but at last he will be
happy," she said, thinking bitterly of that year in which
she had lived with Eliot, less to him, as she thought, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
his sisters, or the governess even, wearing his name because
it had been given not in love, but through an instinct of
tender pity.</p>

<p>She was older, wiser, now than she had been before
Sylvie made that cruel revelation to her that winter night,
and she chafed with shame at remembering the position
she had filled in Eliot's home&mdash;that of a wife in name
only, unloved and barely endured.</p>

<p>"How they must have pitied and despised me!" she
thought, with hot tears in her dark eyes as the express
train rushed along through the night. "Ah, it is better,
better for us both that things fell out as they did. I have
a very jealous mind. I should never have forgotten that
he loved Ida Hayes first, that he married me for pity's
sake, so I never should have been quite sure of his heart.
Ah, I wish&mdash;wish," with a choking sob, "that we had
died together in madame's underground prison!"</p>

<p>And in this wretched frame of mind, bitter and despairing,
Una went away from Boston and her husband, back
to the South and the Convent of Le Bon Berger.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.</a></h2>


<p>Before the wedding-day rolled around Maud and her
betrothed had persuaded Edith and Eliot to accompany
them on their wedding-journey South. In fact, they were
not hard to persuade, for Eliot, in a mood of desperation,
felt almost ready to storm the convent walls and carry
away his beloved, obdurate Una, while Edith was charmed
at the idea of rushing so precipitately from the icy streets
and freezing wind of Boston to the sunshine and flowers
of a warmer clime.</p>

<p>So, one bright March morning, about six years from the
time of Eliot's former visit to New Orleans, the party
found themselves driving through the streets of the Crescent
City to the palatial home of Pierre Carmontelle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
which, during the two months of his betrothal to Maud,
had been elegantly refitted for his bride.</p>

<p>New Orleans was in a great stir and bustle then, for it
was the first year of the Southern Exposition. The city
was crowded with visitors from all parts of the United
States.</p>

<p>Maud and Edith were charmed with the quaint old city,
and the warm, sweet air, and took the greatest pleasure in
threading the Exposition grounds, exclaiming with delight
when now and then they encountered the familiar faces of
Northern friends, sight-seeing like themselves.</p>

<p>They were so busy daily "doing" the Exposition, that
Eliot and Carmontelle did not get time to go down to the
club, or they would have heard news that would have surprised
them.</p>

<p>It came upon them suddenly one day, when, on leaving
the Exposition grounds, the four came face to face with an
entering couple&mdash;M. Remond, the wicked Frenchman, and
the no less wicked Mme. Lorraine.</p>

<p>Madame was clinging to the arm of the dark-faced,
elegant-looking Remond. She was in a tasteful Parisian
costume, smiling and insolent, and looking not a day older
than she did six years ago.</p>

<p>When she met the startled regard of those four pairs of
eyes, she uttered an exclamation of amazement, and her
cheek momentarily whitened through its rouge. The next
instant her insolent courage returned. She smiled a
bright, cold, conventional smile, bowed, and passed quickly
on with her companion.</p>

<p>The others looked at each other with startled eyes.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" queried Eliot Van Zandt,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Let us call at the club to-night, and perhaps we can
find out something," answered his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>They went accordingly, and great was the sensation created
among their old friends by their reappearance after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the lapse of years. Markham, the bachelor, was there,
with some crow's-feet about the eyes and gray hairs in his
brown locks to attest the flight of time. When questioned
about Remond and Mme. Lorraine, he replied, laughing:</p>

<p>"Fancy their hardihood in coming here for their wedding-tour.
They are married, you know."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Fact! It was announced in our papers two months
ago. Married in Paris, and came here a week ago. I am
told that they are staying at madame's house on Esplanade
Street, but none of the Jockey Club has called on the
wretches."</p>

<p>"One there is who will call," Carmontelle said, boldly.
"What say you, Van Zandt? Shall we go to Esplanade
Street and have it out with that fiendish woman?"</p>

<p>Eliot looked rather mystified, but he signified his assent.</p>

<p>"I will go, but&mdash;when?" he asked, and his friend answered:</p>

<p>"Now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, lads, put it off till to-morrow," cried the
gay Markham. "I should like to go and back you up in
the row, but I have an engagement for this evening."</p>

<p>"Sorry, but can't wait," Carmontelle answered.
"Come, Eliot. Markham, adieu. You and the club
will call at the Magnolias? Introduce you to my bride
and her sister. Handsomest girls in Boston, and both
geniuses."</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;only too happy to accept your kind invitation,"
Mr. Markham said, genially; and then they were
out in the street, bound for the presence of the woman who
had wrought such woe to Eliot Van Zandt and his lovely
bride.</p>

<p>"Your object?" Eliot asked his friend, dubiously.</p>

<p>"Can you not guess? She shall tell us the tale she told
Una that night in Boston, and we shall be the judges as to
whether the barrier is great enough to separate you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
your wife forever. Who knows but that Una, in her
strange commingling of pride and humility, may have exaggerated
the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I have always thought so&mdash;always believed that I
could overthrow all her objections, and win her back if
only I could have an interview with her again," Eliot said;
then, sighing, "But I shall never have the chance. She
will never come out of that grim convent again."</p>

<p>"Who knows? We will hope so, anyhow;" and then
they were silent until their carriage drew up before the
front of madame's well-remembered house, once so familiar
to the club in the days when she was such a fascinating
siren and kept all her wickedness carefully hidden in the
background.</p>

<p>Lights glimmered brightly in the front of the house.
The prim, ugly Mima opened the door to them and frowned
darkly.</p>

<p>Was Mme. Lorraine at home? She took their cards and
said, curtly, that she would see if Mme. Remond was in.</p>

<p>In another moment she came back and ushered them
into the pretty salon. Remond was present, but retreated
with a scowl upon their entrance.</p>

<p>The bride, all in silvery white silk cut <i>décolleté</i>, with
diamonds shimmering on arms and breast, rose smilingly
and bowed.</p>

<p>"This is an unexpected honor!" she said, with insolent
<i>empressement</i>.</p>

<p>"You know to what cause to attribute the honor,"
Pierre Carmontelle said, icily.</p>

<p>"No," with a puzzled, inquiring tone; then, with a
roguish ripple of laughter, "Ah, to congratulate me on
my marriage, I suppose?"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.</a></h2>


<p>"Scarcely," answered Carmontelle, dryly, for Eliot
Van Zandt seemed to have no words at his command. He
could only gaze in horror at the vindictive woman. The
former went on curtly, and in tones of calm authority:
"We are here, madame, to hear from your own lips the
strange story with which you sundered two loving hearts
five years ago."</p>

<p>A sneer curled the lips of the handsome, heartless
woman.</p>

<p>"You use romantic phrases, monsieur," she said.</p>

<p>"But true ones," he replied.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"We are waiting to hear the story you told Mr. Van
Zandt's wife&mdash;the story that parted them," he answered
again.</p>

<p>She shot a quick, inquiring glance at Eliot's agitated
face.</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;you are divorced and married again, monsieur,
are you not?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered; "I shall never have any other
wife but her whom you drove from me by your treachery
that night."</p>

<p>Madame was genuinely puzzled this time, for she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Bryant Van Zandt told me you hated
Little Nobody, and would have married her sister Ida, only
for the circumstances that forced you into a hated marriage."</p>

<p>"It is false! I never loved Ida, nor one but the
girl I made my wife!" exclaimed Eliot, indignantly; and
his brother-in-law added:</p>

<p>"He loved Una from the first time he met her here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and when she was imprisoned with him in your secret
cellar, she must have died of starvation but that he opened
a vein in his arm and fed the dying girl with his own
blood. Does not that prove the love he had for his wife?"</p>

<p>A bitter, ghastly change came over madame's rouged
face, with a gasp, she reeled backward into a chair, and
lifted her heavy eyes to Eliot's face.</p>

<p>"You loved her like that?" she cried; "and I&mdash;oh, I
believed that you hated her! I was so glad, so glad! But&mdash;yes,
it is better so; my revenge is more complete, for I
have made you both suffer where I believed that it was
only her heart I broke!"</p>

<p>"Fiend!" exclaimed Eliot.</p>

<p>And Carmontelle echoed:</p>

<p>"Fiend!"</p>

<p>The angry woman only laughed mockingly, as she said:</p>

<p>"Revenge is sweet! You scorned me, Eliot Van
Zandt, for that slip of a girl, and now I have my pay!"</p>

<p>And throwing back her handsome head against the
silken back of her chair, she laughed low and exultantly.</p>

<p>"We did not come here for recriminations, Madame
Remond. We came, as I explained just now, to hear the
story you told Una."</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>, monsieur; but your friend there will be sorry
when he hears it. In fact, his Una wished him never to
know it," madame said, maliciously.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt it was something very horrible, but
doubtless it was an untruth. We wish to hear and judge
for ourselves," was her opponent's undaunted reply.</p>

<p>She glared at him, and muttered something uncomplimentary
beneath her breath, but he continued, coolly:</p>

<p>"Go on and tell us, please. We do not wish to detain
your <i>estimable</i> husband much longer from his amiable
bride!"</p>

<p>"Very well, then, since you will have it, here is Una's
history in a nutshell: She is a child of shame."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"You told me that once before; also, that she was your
child, but I did not believe you," answered Carmontelle.</p>

<p>She glared at him angrily, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, part of it was untrue, but so much the worse for
the girl. She might better be my child than the offspring
of a slave with a taint of African blood in her veins!"</p>

<p>"Woman!"</p>

<p>Eliot had sprung at her fiercely and clutched her white
shoulder in a grasp like steel. He shook her wildly in a
tempest of rage.</p>

<p>"Unsay that lie!" he hissed, fiercely, with blazing eyes.
Madame turned, shrieking, to Carmontelle.</p>

<p>"Make him take his hands off me!" she panted, in
terror. "Do not let him kill me for telling the truth!"</p>

<p>It looked indeed as if her life was in danger, for Eliot's
face worked with fury, and sparks of fire seemed to flash
from his angry eyes. It was with the greatest difficulty
that Carmontelle dragged him away from the frightened
woman and forced him into a seat.</p>

<p>"Be calm," he said. "Do not let her lies put you
into a passion."</p>

<p>"Prove them lies if you can!" she screamed, losing her
self-possession in anger at his incredulity.</p>

<p>"I shall certainly endeavor to do so," he replied, calmly.
"But go on; finish the details of your story. So our
Una was a slave's child, you say? Who, then, was her
father?"</p>

<p>"You force me to disgrace the dead!" she flashed.
"Very well, then, it was Monsieur Lorraine."</p>

<p>"Lorraine dead?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," sullenly.</p>

<p>"I remember Lorraine well. He was an exceedingly
homely man. Una does not resemble him in the least,"
said aggravating Carmontelle.</p>

<p>Flashing him a fiery glance, she retorted:</p>

<p>"No, but she resembles her mother, the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
quadroon whom he gave me for a maid when I came to
this house a bride the last year of the war. Una was a
pretty little infant then, and the young quadroon, in a fit
of jealous fury, told me all. Lorraine whipped her cruelly,
and in her rage she stabbed herself to death. The
world says that I made him jealous and drove him mad,
but it is untrue. Remorse over the quadroon's death
drove him inside the walls of a lunatic asylum." She
paused a moment, then added: "I have told you now the
simple truth, the same that I told the girl in Boston. She
is the daughter of Monsieur Lorraine and his beautiful
slave, and was in infancy a slave herself, until the failure
of the Southern Confederacy freed her in common with all
the other slaves."</p>

<p>She laughed aloud at the white horror of Eliot Van
Zandt's face as he crouched upon a sofa at the further
end of the room.</p>

<p>"A slave's child the bride of one of the proud, highly
born Van Zandts! I am well avenged!" she exclaimed,
fiendishly.</p>

<p>Carmontelle turned to his friend.</p>

<p>"Poor Una!" he said; "it is no wonder she fled in
dismay, after hearing such a tale of horror. Come, let us
go. We have heard all that madame's malignity can invent
to torture two loving hearts, and the only task that
remains to us is to prove it false."</p>

<p>"Which you will never do!" she exclaimed, with triumphant
malice.</p>

<p>"Time will prove," he retorted, as he led the agitated
Van Zandt out of the house, ignoring the ceremony of
adieus to its mistress.</p>

<p>But his face grew very grave once they gained the darkness
of the street. To himself he said, in alarm:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can her tale be true? It sounded very plausible."</p>

<p>To Eliot he said:</p>

<p>"I shall put this affair in the hands of one who will sift
it to the bottom. Then, if Madame Remond has lied to
us, she shall suffer for her sin."</p>

<p>"Poor Una! my poor little Una! How she must have
suffered, bearing this bitter knowledge alone!" Eliot said,
and a bursting sigh heaved his tortured breast.</p>

<p>"She was a wise little girl, at all events," Carmontelle
answered, gravely. "Of course, if madame's tale be true,
there was no other way proper for either, cruel as it seems
to say it."</p>

<p>Eliot had no answer ready, but in his heart he knew
that his friend spoke truly. Better, far better, that he
and Una should suffer than to throw the blighting disgrace
of his wife's parentage upon unborn descendants of the
proud name of Van Zandt.</p>

<p>He could hardly share the incredulity of Carmontelle.
Madame's story had been so plausible it had shaken his
doubts. Now, indeed, it seemed to him that all hope was
over. He and Una were indeed parted forever.</p>

<p>He went back to the Magnolias with his friend, and excusing
himself from all society, went up to his room alone.
He spent some time leaning from the window, his sad gaze
roving over the moonlit city, thinking of Una, his lost
bride, so near him that an hour's rapid walking would
have borne him to her side, but sundered so widely apart
from him by sorrow.</p>

<p>There came to him in the stillness a memory of the song
he had sung to her so often, and which she had loved so
well, "The Two Little Lives." How well it fitted now!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah! for the morrow bringeth such sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Captured the lark was, and life grew dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There, too, the daisy torn from the way-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Prisoned and dying wept for him<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Once more the lark sung; fainter his voice grew;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>"Poor little daisy!" Eliot sighed; then, bitterly, "Ah,
if we had but died in prison that time, how blessed we
should have been&mdash;never having this cruel knowledge to
break our hearts!"</p>

<p>He flung himself down on the bed and tried to sleep. A
disturbed slumber, mixed with frightful dreams, came to
him. His head was hot, and his thirst was excessive. He
rose several times and groped his way to the ice-pitcher,
drinking greedily, until at last he had drained it all. In
the morning they found him there delirious.</p>

<p>The old doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>"Brain fever!" he said. "He has had some terrible
shock, I think, from the symptoms. I shall send you a
trained hospital nurse, Carmontelle, for there must be
careful nursing here if we bring the poor fellow out
alive."</p>

<p>The nurse came, and was duly installed in his position,
aided and abetted by Maud and Edith.</p>

<p>Carmontelle, after a day or two, stole away from the
house long enough to consult his family lawyer on the
subject of ferreting to the bottom the story the wicked
Mme. Remond had told him of Una's birth.</p>

<p>At an early period of the narration of his story the
lawyer became visibly excited.</p>

<p>"Go on. Tell me everything," he said, nervously, and
Carmontelle obeyed.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Mr. Frayser cried out, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, Carmontelle, I believe the good Lord
himself has sent you to me. You know I was Lorraine's
lawyer?"</p>

<p>"I did not know it," was the answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Frayser; "and my client died a few
months ago, in an insane asylum."</p>

<p>"So I was told by Madame Lorraine&mdash;or, as I should
perhaps say, Remond."</p>

<p>"Yes, she married that wretch some time ago, and they
came on here after Lorraine's death, to look after his
property."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Carmontelle, rather indifferently. He was
not much interested in the dead man's property.</p>

<p>"Lorraine was immensely rich, you know," continued
Frayser. "Madame thought she would step into the
money without let or hinderance. She wanted to sell all
the property in New Orleans and get away with the spoils."</p>

<p>"Yes," absently.</p>

<p>The little lawyer smiled.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you don't look much interested," he said;
"but listen: Monsieur Lorraine left a box of private papers
in my safe when he first employed me as his lawyer, at the
time of his marriage to the actress. When I examined
these papers, after his death, I found that the greater part
of his wealth did not belong to him, but was held in trust
for another person."</p>

<p>"Another person!" Carmontelle echoed, brightening
up with sudden curiosity.</p>

<p>"A little child," continued Frayser, his little black eyes
twinkling with fun at Carmontelle's eagerness.</p>

<p>"Go on, go on."</p>

<p>"It seems that Lorraine had an only sister who was
married during the war to a very wealthy man, a colonel&mdash;<i>mon
Dieu</i>! Carmontelle, what a coincidence! it was
your own name&mdash;he was a Colonel Carmontelle!"</p>

<p>"And lived in Alabama&mdash;and was killed in battle just
before the close of the war. He was my cousin!" exclaimed
Carmontelle, excitedly.</p>

<p>"The same," replied the lawyer. "Well, his death
was such a shock to his young wife that, when her little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
one was born, a month later, she died&mdash;of heart-break, or,
at least, so say the letters of her friends, that were written
from Alabama to summon him to come for the little
orphan heiress."</p>

<p>"Una!" exclaimed Carmontelle, radiantly.</p>

<p>"Most likely," said the lawyer, smiling. "But permit
me to go on with my prosaic story. According to these
private papers, some of which are in the form of memorandums,
Lorraine brought the babe to New Orleans with
its negro nurse, and very soon afterward married, more
for the child's sake than his own, and went to housekeeping
on Esplanade Street."</p>

<p>"All is clear as day. Thank the good God, Una's
stainless parentage is established, and I will go this day
and bring her to the side of her suffering husband," Carmontelle
exclaimed, joyously.</p>

<p>"I think you may safely do so," smiled the delighted
lawyer. "But I have still more to tell you. The physician
in charge at the asylum where Lorraine died wrote to
me to come and make preparations for his burial. I went
and heard a strange story. Lorraine, in his last illness,
had recovered his reason and memory. He had dictated
and signed a paper to be given to me. You shall read it
yourself."</p>

<p>He brought out from his desk the paper, and Carmontelle
eagerly ran over the contents.</p>

<p>Briefly, it was to the effect that Lorraine, just previous
to the insanity that had overtaken him, had found out that
his wife was false to him, and that she had married him
only for the money which she believed to be his own.
Realizing suddenly that he had made no arrangements by
which his little niece would receive her inheritance, should
he be suddenly stricken by death, and fearful of Mme.
Lorraine's treachery in the matter, he had executed a will
in which he left to the little Mary Carmontelle the whole
of his own small patrimony, together with the wealth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
her dead father. He had hidden the will in the library,
intending to place it in Frayser's care, but his mind had
suddenly gone wrong with the stress of trouble, and his
removal by his wife to an insane asylum had put a sudden
end to everything.</p>

<p>"Madame knows all this?" Carmontelle queried, looking
up from the paper.</p>

<p>"Yes; for I confronted her with it when she came to
me to settle up the property. She was as bold as brass,
and declared that the child had died in infancy. I made
a search in the library, all the same, for the missing will,
but it could not be found. Doubtless that wicked woman
has destroyed it. I would not take her word that the little
heiress was dead, as she could offer no proof at all except
the word of that grim maid-servant of hers, so I have been
advertising in a number of papers for the child or young
lady, as she is now, if living. You will see from that
paper that I am appointed her guardian until her marriage."</p>

<p>"She has been married nearly six years. Dear little
Una! she is my cousin, and the name I gave her when I
adopted her as my daughter was really her own. It is the
oddest thing, too, that the nuns at the convent baptized
her Marie, her own name, but in the French form. Fact
is certainly stranger than fiction!" exclaimed Maud's husband,
in wonder and delight.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful, certainly," agreed Frayser, "and
your visit to me to-day is one of the most wonderful
things about it. I was beginning to give up all hope of
finding the missing heiress, and Mme. Remond and her
rascally husband were pressing me so furiously that I was
beginning to fear I must make some concessions to them.
But now all is made plain, and I can lay my hand on Lorraine's
niece and heiress and oust her enemy from the
place she has usurped so long. But I must tell you one
thing, unless that missing will can be found, the ex-actress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
will make us trouble yet over Mrs. Van Zandt's inheritance."</p>

<p>"Never mind about the will now. What is money
when it lies in our power to reunite the crushed hearts of
that long-parted husband and wife. Let us get into my
carriage and go and fetch Una away from her convent to
the side of her sick husband!" cried Carmontelle.</p>

<p>"Agreed with all my heart!" answered Frayser.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVI" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI.</a></h2>


<p>Carmontelle found, as once before, his old acquaintance
with the mother superior at the convent of good avail
in securing admittance. The good woman met him in
some wonder, and bowed stiffly to the little lawyer, who
was looking about him in a good deal of curiosity.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this visit?" she inquired,
with calm dignity, although perfectly certain that it related
to Una.</p>

<p>She was not mistaken, for he immediately asked for her,
and was told that Una would receive no one.</p>

<p>"She is constantly engaged in devotion, fitting herself
to retire forever from the world."</p>

<p>"She will have to let the devotions go, and return to
the world," Carmontelle answered, bluntly.</p>

<p>"Monsieur!" reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," he replied, earnestly. "I have
to-day made discoveries that prove her the daughter of
honorable parents&mdash;also heiress to a large fortune. There
is nothing now to prevent her return to the world and to
her husband, who has suffered so much from their separation."</p>

<p>Madame, the superior, was unaffectedly happy at hearing
this news.</p>

<p>"Thank <i>le bon Dieu</i> that it is so!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, how the poor little one has suffered, believing the
falsehood of wicked Madame Lorraine."</p>

<p>She went hurriedly to seek Una with the joyful tidings,
but it was some time before she returned.</p>

<p>In truth, Una had been almost overcome by the shock
of joy after the long night of sorrow and despair.</p>

<p>"I am not the child of infamy! The blood that flows
through my veins is noble and untainted! Heaven, I
thank Thee!" cried the tortured girl, falling down upon
her knees and hiding her face in her hands as she leaned
forward upon her low cot bed.</p>

<p>To the good nun's announcement that she was an
heiress, she had paid no attention, everything else being
swallowed up in the glad news that her birth was honorable.</p>

<p>After the sorrow and despair she had experienced such
a revulsion of feeling, such intense happiness rushed over
her that her senses for a moment succumbed to the shock,
and the nun, bending forward to look at her, presently
found she had quietly fainted.</p>

<p>The application of a little cold water soon revived her,
and the mother superior exclaimed, cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Oh, fy! my dear, I did not know that you would take
my good news so ill, or I would have broken it to you
more carefully."</p>

<p>"Tell me more. What is my name? Who are my
kinspeople, and why was I left so long to the cruel mercy
of Madame Lorraine?" exclaimed Una, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Come with me. Our old friend, Pierre Carmontelle,
is down-stairs. He will tell you all."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Carmontelle! He has always been my
friend," cried the girl, thinking remorsefully of the way
she had snubbed him that day in Boston when he had followed
her to the banker's gate, frightened because she
feared he would betray her to Eliot.</p>

<p>Now she ran joyfully to his presence, and he started in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
surprise at her wondrous beauty that shone star-like from
its setting of simple convent black.</p>

<p>"Heavens, Una! how lovely you have grown!" he exclaimed,
gayly. "I may take the privilege of praising
you, although you are a married woman, since you are my
kinswoman by two distinct ties."</p>

<p>"Your kinswoman!" the girl echoed, amazedly, and he
explained, laughingly:</p>

<p>"You are my cousin's daughter for one thing, and for
the other you are my sister-in-law."</p>

<p>"What can you mean?"</p>

<p>"I married Maud Van Zandt two weeks ago," he replied.</p>

<p>The warm color came rushing into Una's pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, "how happy you make me. And
dear Maud&mdash;is she here?"</p>

<p>"She is at my home, the Magnolias. Have you any
one else to ask about, <i>belle cousine</i>?" chaffingly.</p>

<p>"E&mdash;dith?" falteringly, and blushing up to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Edith is at the Magnolias, too. Ah, I see your eyes
asking me about some one else. No wonder you are
ashamed to speak his name after the shameful way you
have treated him. Well, I will be generous, Mrs. Van
Zandt. Eliot&mdash;ah! now I see how you can blush&mdash;is also at
my home, and presently I am going to take another guest
to the Magnolias&mdash;even yourself."</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;not until you tell me all!" the girl faltered,
trembling with such happiness that she could scarcely
speak.</p>

<p>So, then and there he told her all the story of Mme.
Lorraine's treachery and cupidity&mdash;told her everything,
except the story of Eliot's illness that might possibly terminate
fatally, and so wreck the happy ending of their
checkered love story.</p>

<p>When he had finished the story, with the aid of the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
lawyer, who was charmed with the beauty of the young
heiress, he said, kindly:</p>

<p>"Will you come with me to the Magnolias, now, Una?"</p>

<p>She looked radiantly at the nun, who answered, with
genuine happiness:</p>

<p>"Of course she will, monsieur, as soon as she retires to
her room and assumes her worldly garb. I am sorry to
lose our sweet Una, but not selfish enough to regret her
good fortune that has made it possible for her to be happy
once more in the world. I see plainly that Heaven did
not intend for her to be a nun."</p>

<p>Father Quentin began to believe this, too, when she
withdrew to acquaint him with the startling news, and
when Una came down, after laying off her convent dress
forever, in hat and cloak, to depart from Le Bon Berger,
the old priest's aged hands were laid solemnly on her
golden head a moment, and his quavering old voice tenderly
blessed her and commended her to the care of
Heaven.</p>

<p>All the nuns and convent pupils were assembled to bid
her adieu, and followed by their tears and blessings, Una
went away with Carmontelle, her new-found kinsman, to
the Magnolias.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVII" id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII.</a></h2>


<p>No one met them in the library, to which he conducted
Una. Maud and Edith were upstairs in close attendance
upon Eliot. Carmontelle saw that the girl was trembling
with nervous excitement, and brought her a sedative to
drink.</p>

<p>"No one knows anything yet?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"No; and I am going to let you rest and recover yourself
first, before I bring Maud and Edith to you; and Eliot
you shall see last of all."</p>

<p>He left her waiting there, and went upstairs to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the news to his young wife and Edith. Eliot was still delirious,
and carefully watched by his attentive nurse. He
beckoned the girls into another room, and told them
everything, then stood smiling at their tears of joy.</p>

<p>"Eliot will get well now with his wife come home to
him," he said. "So run down to the library like good
girls now, and kiss your sister Una, and break the news of
Eliot's illness to her as gently as you can."</p>

<p>They needed no second bidding, but flew softly to the
library, and Una soon found herself in danger of being
smothered in the energetic clasp of four round white arms,
while dual tears and kisses fell on her golden head and
lovely face.</p>

<p>Una was glad, more glad than words could tell, at this
happy meeting, but when the first joy was past, her dark
eyes wandered eagerly toward the door. The two sisters
understood.</p>

<p>"You are looking for Eliot, dear," said Maud. "He
can not come to you now, dear. You see, the poor boy is
sick&mdash;he has had such trouble over losing you, Una&mdash;but
now he will get well. You shall help us to nurse him back
to health."</p>

<p>And so, in gentle tones, they broke to her the news of
Eliot's illness, and presently carried her off with them to
look at him where he lay, with burning eyes and crimson
face, among his pillows. But he did not recognize the fair
young wife who looked at him with eyes full of love and
grief, and pressed passionate lips on his hot brow. He
only smiled vacantly, and turning from her, began to talk
in his restless delirium, strange, disconnected, meaningless
phrases that struck dismay to Una's heart, and chilled the
blood in her young veins.</p>

<p>"He will never get well; he will die, my love, my darling,
my husband!" she cried out, shrilly, in sudden terror
and despair.</p>

<p>And Eliot turned his heavy head toward her, as if some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
chord of memory had been struck by her voice, and began
to babble of other things&mdash;of the dark days of imprisonment
in the cellar-room of the house on Esplanade Street,
of the beloved little companion who had shared those horrors,
and whose life he had saved by that desperate deed of
self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>She stood listening with dark, dilated eyes, hearing for
the first time how her life had been saved that night.</p>

<p>Carmontelle was standing close by her side.</p>

<p>She turned her dark, amazed, tear-wet eyes on his face,
and murmured hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Is it truth, or the ravings of fever and delirium?"</p>

<p>"It is truth," he answered; and, with a wild, remorseful
cry, Una ran out of the room.</p>

<p>He followed her into the next apartment. She had
thrown herself into a chair, and was sobbing wildly.</p>

<p>"Una, why do you take it so hard?" he expostulated.
"Surely, no wife could object to such devoted love!"</p>

<p>She looked up at him with agonized entreaty in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Was it love, or&mdash;pity?" she cried. "I&mdash;I thought&mdash;Sylvie
Van Zandt told me so&mdash;that he loved Ida Hayes before
he ever met me, and would have married her but for
that&mdash;trouble&mdash;that forced him to make me his wife."</p>

<p>"It was a fiendish falsehood!" declared Carmontelle,
emphatically. "Eliot never thought of Ida Hayes. He
loved you from the first moment he saw you."</p>

<p>"Ignorant Little Nobody as I was?" she exclaimed, in
wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes; ignorant Little Nobody that you were!" he replied,
smiling. "He told me before he married you how
glad he was that a strange fate had given you to his keeping.
You were destined for my bride, you know, and Van
Zandt, being poor, would not tell his love until that happy
accident gave you to his arms."</p>

<p>She exclaimed remorsefully:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, what a wretch I was to believe Sylvie and doubt
my noble husband! I thought, when I ran away, that he
would get a divorce and marry Ida. But he loved me all
the time, my noble darling! Oh, if I had known before
that it was his precious life-current he gave me to drink,
that time when we both believed I was dying, all would
have been so different. I could not then have doubted his
fidelity. No wonder I could not keep from loving him all
the time, when it was his own life flowing in my veins and
keeping me faithful to my husband."</p>

<p>"Do not blame yourself for doubting him; it was but
natural, my dear," said her cousin. "Mrs. Bryant Van
Zandt is the only one to blame. She hated you because
you spoiled her match-making. But now you will have
your revenge on that treacherous doll. You will be much
richer than she is, and can queen it over Sylvie and Ida in
royal fashion."</p>

<p>She smiled through her tears, but answered:</p>

<p>"I do not care for the money, only to make dear Eliot
rich. Oh, cousin, do you think he will get well? Heaven
would not be so cruel as to take him from me now!"</p>

<p>"I trust, indeed, that he will be spared to us," Carmontelle
answered, evasively, for he was secretly alarmed
at Eliot's condition.</p>

<p>But he would not communicate his fears to the alarmed
wife and sisters, only enjoined them to be careful and
watchful over Eliot. Indeed, he himself often shared the
vigils of the nurse, who was a rather old-looking man, and
inclined to resent the aid he received from the family, declaring
that he could care for his patient better alone.</p>

<p>Una had taken a distaste to the nurse from the first,
and her unaccountable aversion increased as Eliot grew no
better with the lapse of days, and showed no sign of recognition
of the dear ones who surrounded him.</p>

<p>Carmontelle spoke to the doctor about the cross nurse,
but he only laughed, and said that nurses were always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
jealous of interference with their patients, and that the
man was splendid in his vocation; so Una tried to dismiss
her antipathy to him as unjust and unfounded.</p>

<p>But one night the physician declared that he saw a
change in his patient&mdash;a crisis was approaching, and he
hoped the change would be for the better. He left,
promising to return at midnight, and enjoining the utmost
quiet and care in the sick-room, so that Eliot might not
be aroused from the deep slumber into which he had
fallen.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Johnson, the nurse, declared that
he must have the sick-room alone with his patient.</p>

<p>"The crisis is all-important," he said. "When he
awakens it will be to life or death, and in spite of Doctor
Pomeroy's flattering words, I fear it will be death. When
he wakes, I must be alone with him that he may not be
excited and frightened by your anxious faces. I hope you
will all go to your rooms and rest. I will call each one
immediately upon the slightest change in the patient."</p>

<p>They all promised, but Una's pledge was most reluctant.
She looked pleadingly at Johnson, and he returned
her gaze sullenly, as it seemed to her, through the goggle
glasses he wore.</p>

<p>She went to her own room, just a little lower down the
hall, and sat down at the window, consumed with suspense
and restlessness. The hours passed slowly, drearily, and
at last she could bear the torture of her thoughts no longer.</p>

<p>"I will go to the room next to Eliot's and wait. No
one will see or hear me, and it can do no harm," she
thought.</p>

<p>Wrapping a dark shawl about her shoulders, for the
midnight hour was chilly, Una glided like a spirit along
the dark corridor until she gained the little ante-chamber
next to the sick-room. The outer door was ajar, and also
the one that opened into Eliot's room. The anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
young wife moved softly across the soundless carpet and
peered around the door.</p>

<p>Then her shriek of terror, fear, and agony rang shrilly
through the house.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVIII" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII">CHAPTER XLVIII.</a></h2>


<p>That agonized shriek brought Pierre Carmontelle rushing
from his room, followed by Maud, while Edith came
from another direction, and men-servants and maid-servants
came flying up the stairs, all with one thought in
their minds. The sufferer was dead, and that bitter cry
had come from the lips of the bereaved young wife.</p>

<p>But when they rushed into the room, a tragic scene
greeted their eyes.</p>

<p>Una, in the center of the floor, was struggling heroically
with a man, who was holding a pillow over her face and
head, and on the floor lay a gray wig and beard and goggle
glasses. Una's assailant was Louis Remond. One fierce
blow from Carmontelle's fist knocked the villain down,
and before he could rise, an emphatic kick temporarily relieved
him of consciousness. Two men-servants, comprehending
the scene with uncommon rapidity, dragged the
wretch out into the corridor and speedily bound him hand
and foot. In the meantime, Una, from the bedside to
which she had instantly flown, was explaining, through
hushed sobs:</p>

<p>"I peeped in at the door, and Johnson was holding a
pillow down over Eliot's face. I screamed, and he rushed
at me with the pillow, and would have smothered me in
another instant but for your entrance."</p>

<p>"The hound!" Carmontelle said, fiercely; then, kicking
the disguises into view, he said: "These must have
been knocked off in the scuffle. Johnson was Louis
Remond in disguise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>Una shuddered, then turned toward the bed. She stifled
a cry of unutterable joy.</p>

<p>Eliot was unharmed, for at that instant he opened his
eyes naturally, like one awaking from a long sleep, and
their calm, steady gaze rested on that lovely, agitated face
with its dark, loving eyes and the golden hair shadowing
the wan temples.</p>

<p>"Una, darling!" he said, not as one surprised or excited,
but gently and quietly, as one who has been very
sick always accepts even the strangest things as a matter
of course.</p>

<p>The crisis had passed, and Eliot and Una had escaped
the malignancy of the two enemies who sought their lives,
for a plot was unearthed that night that led to the conviction
of Mme. Remond as well as her husband.</p>

<p>She was found in the house, in the guise of a female
servant, and had arranged to take Una's life that night,
by means of poison in her drinking-water, while Remond,
who had bribed the hospital nurse, and so usurped his
place, was to smother Eliot with a pillow.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the cruel conspiracy was discovered and
averted, and the two conspirators were soon tried, convicted,
and sentenced to a long term in the penitentiary.
Madame died before her term expired, but Remond escaped
from prison and made his way out of the country, never
returning to it, through fear of apprehension.</p>

<p>At Mme. Remond's trial, when she found that everything
was going against her, she sullenly confessed that
she lied when she tried to palm off upon Una the story
that she was of shameful parentage.</p>

<p>"I thought, when I married Lorraine, that all the
money was his, and I hated him and the heiress, too, when
I found out the real truth. I only wish I had killed her
when she was a baby, then all this trouble had been avoided,"
she said, with vindictive frankness.</p>

<p>Eliot convalesced very fast, to the great delight of Una<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and the family, and one day, when the little lawyer had
fretted over the missing will of M. Lorraine, she said to
her husband:</p>

<p>"Tell me what a legal document looks like?"</p>

<p>He described it to her, and her eyes grew bright with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Eliot, you remember the great dictionary in which you
showed me the definition of Friend, that first night we
met? Well, there was just such a paper in that book, and
if it has escaped madame's search, is there yet, and may
prove to be the missing will."</p>

<p>Her surmise was correct, and the lawyer was very happy
when he got the legal document into his hands. It proved
Una, beyond a doubt, Colonel Carmontelle's daughter,
and the richest heiress in New Orleans.</p>

<p>"But you loved me, Eliot, when I was only Little
Nobody. I shall always be prouder of that, darling, than
of my wealth," said happy Una.</p>
